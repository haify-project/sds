"""What the Cinder driver does, in Haify's terms.

One Cinder volume is one Haify resource with one DRBD volume. A compute host
reads and writes it through /dev/drbd/by-res/<resource>/0, locally when it
holds a replica and over the network as a diskless client when it does not.

DRBD lets one node write at a time and Haify resources are created with
`auto-promote no`, so attaching a volume to a host makes it Primary there and
detaching it makes it Secondary. A live migration needs it Primary on both
hosts for a moment: Nova attaches the volume to the destination while the
source still has it, and detaches it from the source once the guest has
moved. The dual-primary window is opened for exactly that case, a Primary on
a host that holds an attachment of the volume; Nova evacuates a guest by
deleting the old host's attachment first, so an evacuation never opens it.

Nothing here imports Cinder, so the logic is tested without an install.
