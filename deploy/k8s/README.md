# Haify CSI driver

Driver name: `haify.csi.liliang-cn.com`. Everything is deployed into
`kube-system` except the optional Copilot RBAC (`60-haify-ai-apps-rbac.yaml`,
namespace `haify-ai`).

| File | What it creates |
| ---- | --------------- |
| `00-csidriver.yaml` | `CSIDriver` (`attachRequired: false`, `storageCapacity: true`, `fsGroupPolicy: File`) |
| `00-haify-controller-endpoint.yaml` | Selectorless `Service` + manual `EndpointSlice` pointing at the external haify-controller |
| `10-rbac.yaml` | ServiceAccounts `haify-csi-controller`, `haify-csi-node`; ClusterRoles for provisioner, snapshotter, resizer and the health reporter |
| `20-controller.yaml` | Deployment `haify-csi-controller`: csi-provisioner, csi-resizer, csi-snapshotter, plugin (`csi-controller`), livenessprobe |
| `30-node.yaml` | DaemonSet `haify-csi-node`: node-driver-registrar, plugin (`csi-node`, privileged) |
| `40-storageclass.yaml` | StorageClass `haify-drbd` |
| `50-volumesnapshotclass.yaml` | VolumeSnapshotClass `haify-drbd-snapshot` (needs the snapshot CRDs, see below) |
| `60-haify-ai-apps-rbac.yaml` | ServiceAccount + token Secret for the Haify Copilot's `haify_k8s_app_create` tool |

## Prerequisites

- Every Kubernetes node that runs volumes is a registered Haify node with the
  DRBD 9 kernel module and `drbd-utils`, and LVM or ZFS. **The Kubernetes node
  name must equal the Haify node name**: the node plugin reports
  `spec.nodeName` as its topology, and the controller plugin matches it against
  `haify node list`. At startup the node plugin registers its node with the
  controller under that name and `status.hostIP` (`--node-name`/`--node-ip`,
  from `NODE_NAME`/`NODE_IP`); registration is idempotent, and the controller
  still needs SSH to that address.
- The Haify pool named in the StorageClass exists on at least `replicas` of
  those nodes (`haify pool create --name vg0 ...`).

## Build the image

Both plugin containers use `haify-csi:latest` with `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`,
so the image must exist on every node. Alternatively, push it to a registry and
put that registry in `20-controller.yaml` / `30-node.yaml`:

    docker build -f Dockerfile.csi -t haify-csi:latest .
    docker save haify-csi:latest | sudo k3s ctr images import -    # on each k3s node

`Dockerfile.csi` cross-compiles for `--platform`, so `docker buildx build
--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 ...` works from either architecture.

## Point the CSI at your haify-controller VIP

The haify-controller runs outside the cluster on the storage hosts, made highly
available behind a floating VIP. `00-haify-controller-endpoint.yaml` ships a selectorless
`Service` named `haify-controller` (port `3374`, named `grpc`) plus a manual
`EndpointSlice` carrying the VIP, so the in-cluster name `haify-controller:3374`
reaches the external controller.

If you are upgrading from a manifest that shipped a v1 `Endpoints` instead,
delete it (`kubectl -n kube-system delete endpoints haify-controller`) after
applying the new file. Otherwise Kubernetes keeps mirroring it into a second
slice.

**You must set the VIP.** Replace the `192.0.2.10` placeholder (marked
`# CHANGE ME`) with your real VIP, which appears as `VIP:` in the output of:

    haify ha self status

The plugins' `--haify-controller=haify-controller:3374` (also the binaries'
default) then resolves without editing the Deployment or DaemonSet. An
`ExternalName` Service does not work here, because the target is an IP rather
than a DNS name.

The controller Deployment and the node DaemonSet both run with
`hostNetwork: true` and `dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet`. Host networking
lets the controller pod reach a VIP that lives on its own node, and the DNS
policy keeps the Service name resolvable.

With `[auth]` or `[rbac]` on the controller, give the plugins its API token
before applying, from a node that holds it:

    kubectl -n kube-system create secret generic haify-api-token --from-file=token=/etc/haify/token

Without that Secret the plugins connect without a token, which only a
controller with authentication off accepts.

Then:

    kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/

## StorageClass parameters

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- | ------- |
| `pool` | required unless `resourceProfile` sets it | Haify pool name as given to `haify pool create --name` (`vg0` and `haify_vg0` both match) |
| `replicas` | `2` | Diskful copies |
| `storageType` | `lvm` | `lvm` or `zfs` |
| `allowRemoteVolumeAccess` | `false` | `true` lets a Pod run on a node with no replica: the node plugin attaches a diskless DRBD client there at stage time and detaches it at unstage. Without it, Pods are pinned to replica nodes |
| `faultDomainLabel` | `host` | Haify node label whose values replicas are spread across (`haify node label <node> host=<name>`); nodes without the label count as their own domain |
| `resourceProfile` | none | Haify resource profile; its pool, replica count and storage type apply unless the StorageClass sets them explicitly |
| `resourceLabels` | none | `key=value,key=value` labels put on the Haify resource. `haify.csi/managed-by=csi` is always added, and `haify.csi/pvc=<namespace>/<name>` names the claim (external-provisioner passes it with `--extra-create-metadata`, which `20-controller.yaml` sets) |

The node the scheduler picked (`WaitForFirstConsumer` with
`--strict-topology`) gets the first replica. The rest go to the nodes whose
pool has the most free space, preferring fault domains no replica uses yet. A volume
that cannot be placed fails with `ResourceExhausted`, which makes
external-provisioner reschedule the Pod.

The filesystem is `ext4` unless the StorageClass sets
`csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype` (the image ships `e2fsprogs` and `xfsprogs`).

## What the driver supports

- Expansion: with `allowVolumeExpansion: true` and the `csi-resizer` sidecar,
  raising a PVC's request grows the LV, DRBD device and filesystem online.
- Capacity-aware scheduling: `storageCapacity: true` and the provisioner's
  `--enable-capacity` publish one `CSIStorageCapacity` per node from its pool's
  free space, so the scheduler does not pick a node that cannot hold the volume.
- Usage metrics: `NodeGetVolumeStats` feeds `kubelet_volume_stats_*` for
  filesystem volumes. Kubelet does not collect usage for raw block volumes.
- Raw block: `volumeMode: Block` hands the Pod the DRBD device itself.
- Access modes: `ReadWriteOnce` and `ReadWriteOncePod`. `ReadWriteMany`
  and the other multi-node modes are refused at provisioning, because a DRBD
  resource has one Primary.
- Replica health on the PVC: the controller plugin checks each volume's
  replicas every `--health-interval` (default `1m`) and posts
  `Warning VolumeDegraded` / `Normal VolumeRecovered` events on its PVC when a
  replica disconnects, loses its disk, falls out of date or resyncs. A new
  volume's initial sync is not reported.

## Volume snapshots

The driver implements `CREATE_DELETE_SNAPSHOT` and `LIST_SNAPSHOTS`. A
`VolumeSnapshot` of a Haify volume becomes an LVM/ZFS snapshot of that volume's
backing store, and Kubernetes backup tools (Velero, Kasten) orchestrate these
snapshots.

Snapshots live on individual storage nodes, with no cluster-wide index, so
`ListSnapshots` walks the driver's volumes and asks each replica node. Only
snapshots the driver created (`haifysnap_*`) are listed; the controller's own
scheduled snapshots of the same LV are not.

### Cluster prerequisites (install once)

k3s and most distributions do not ship the snapshot machinery. Install the
CRDs and the snapshot-controller from
[kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter)
before applying `50-volumesnapshotclass.yaml`:

```bash
V=v8.2.0
B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/$V
kubectl apply -f $B/client/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshotclasses.yaml \
              -f $B/client/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshotcontents.yaml \
              -f $B/client/config/crd/snapshot.storage.k8s.io_volumesnapshots.yaml
kubectl apply -f $B/deploy/kubernetes/snapshot-controller/rbac-snapshot-controller.yaml \
              -f $B/deploy/kubernetes/snapshot-controller/setup-snapshot-controller.yaml
```

### Taking a snapshot

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata: { name: data-snap }
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: haify-drbd-snapshot
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: data
```

`deletionPolicy: Delete` in the shipped class removes the LVM/ZFS snapshot
when the `VolumeSnapshot` is deleted; use `Retain` if it must outlive the
Kubernetes objects.

### What a snapshot is (and is not)

A snapshot is taken on one node's local backing volume, and DRBD does not
replicate it. It protects against logical faults (bad writes, accidental
deletion, a failed migration) but not against losing that node. DRBD replicates
every write, including destructive ones, so replication is not a backup. To
protect against losing the cluster, ship snapshots off-site.

### Restoring and cloning

Both work through a PVC `dataSource`:

```yaml
# restore a snapshot into a new volume
spec:
  dataSource: { name: my-snap, kind: VolumeSnapshot, apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io }

# clone an existing volume
spec:
  dataSource: { name: my-pvc, kind: PersistentVolumeClaim }
```

The new volume is created empty. The source is then copied into the new
volume's DRBD device on the node holding the source, so DRBD replicates the
data to every peer through the normal write path. Placement always includes
that node; if it cannot host a replica, provisioning fails with
`ResourceExhausted`.

- A clone snapshots the source first. Reading a mounted volume's backing store
  directly would capture a torn image, so a clone takes an internal snapshot,
  copies from that, and drops it again.
- `CreateVolume` blocks for the duration of the copy. The shipped provisioner
  `--timeout` is `120s`; raise it for large volumes. If the copy fails, the
  half-written volume is destroyed so a retry starts clean. A controller crash
  mid-copy is the one case that can leave an empty volume behind.

Application-level consistency is up to the application. If you need more than
crash consistency, snapshot a database after a `CHECKPOINT`/`FSYNC` (or
quiesce it).

## When a node dies

When a node loses power, Kubernetes takes about 75 seconds to declare it lost,
and the replacement pod runs on a surviving replica node about 10 seconds
later, with its data intact. Nothing needs cleaning up on the Haify side, and
the old node's replica resynchronises on its own when it comes back.

Almost all of that time is Kubernetes deciding the node is gone. To shorten it
for a workload, lower the `not-ready` and `unreachable` tolerations on the pod:

```yaml
tolerations:
- {key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready,   operator: Exists, effect: NoExecute, tolerationSeconds: 15}
- {key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable, operator: Exists, effect: NoExecute, tolerationSeconds: 15}
```

Only controller-managed pods (Deployment, StatefulSet) are recreated. A bare
`Pod` on a dead node is deleted and stays gone; its volume is kept.

## Haify Copilot access (optional)

`60-haify-ai-apps-rbac.yaml` lets `haify-ai` create databases on Haify volumes
(the `haify_k8s_app_create` tool). It may create namespaces, Secrets, PVCs, Services
and Deployments and read Pods, PVs and StorageClasses; it cannot update or
delete anything. haify-ai runs outside the cluster and reads its kubeconfig from
`HAIFY_AI_KUBECONFIG`. Build one from the token Secret:

```bash
TOKEN=$(kubectl -n haify-ai get secret haify-ai-token -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
kubectl config view --minify --raw --flatten > haify-ai.kubeconfig
KUBECONFIG=haify-ai.kubeconfig kubectl config set-credentials haify-ai --token="$TOKEN"
KUBECONFIG=haify-ai.kubeconfig kubectl config set-context --current --user=haify-ai
```

When the request has no `storageClass`, it picks a Haify StorageClass that does
not set `allowRemoteVolumeAccess: "true"`, falling back to one that does.

## When registry.k8s.io is unreachable

`registry.k8s.io` redirects to regional Google Artifact Registry hosts, which
some networks (mainland China among them) cannot reach. Point k3s at a mirror in
`/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` on every node and restart k3s:

```yaml
mirrors:
  registry.k8s.io:
    endpoint: ["https://k8s.m.daocloud.io"]
```
