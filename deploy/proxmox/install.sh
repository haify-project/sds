Next: add the storage once for the cluster, in the web interface under
Datacenter -> Storage -> Add -> SDS, or in /etc/pve/storage.cfg, e.g.

  sds: sds0
        controller 192.168.1.10
        sdspool vg0
        replicas 2
        content images,rootdir
        shared 1

See storage.cfg.example for every option.
