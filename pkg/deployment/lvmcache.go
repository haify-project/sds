// lvmcache — putting an SSD in front of a slow LVM pool.
//
// These are the raw node interactions only; every decision about whether a
// cache may be attached or detached lives in the controller, where it can be
// tested without a node. The commands are deliberately thin wrappers so that
// what actually runs on a storage node is readable in one place.

// LVMCacheFields is the column list used for every cache query.
//
// The cache does not appear on the row an operator would expect. Caching a
// thin pool attaches the cache to the pool's *data* sub-LV, "[pool_tdata]",
// which lvs hides unless -a is given; the fast device likewise becomes an
// internal LV named "<name>_cvol". So the query asks for every LV in the group,
// including internal ones, and the caller finds the cache by segment type
// rather than by name.
//
// vg_name comes first so a single query can cover every group on a host, which
// is what makes surfacing cache state in `pool list` one extra SSH round for
// the whole cluster rather than one per pool.
