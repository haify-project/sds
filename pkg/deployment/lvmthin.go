// lvmthin — how full a thin pool actually is.
//
// A thin pool's capacity is not its volume group's capacity. SDS gives the
// pool 95% of the VG's free extents at create (all of them on convert-thin),
// so vg_free is near zero from the moment the pool exists and stays there; the
// number that decides whether writes succeed is the pool's own data
// utilisation, which lives on the pool LV.
//
// Both counters here matter independently. A pool whose *metadata* fills up
// fails writes exactly as hard as one whose data fills up, and the two grow
// for unrelated reasons — metadata tracks the number of mapped blocks and
// snapshots, data tracks the bytes in them.

// LVMThinFields is the column list used for thin pool utilisation queries.
//
// vg_name leads so one query can cover every group on a host, matching
// LVMCacheFields: surfacing pool fullness in `pool list` costs one extra SSH
// round for the whole cluster rather than one per pool.
//
// segtype is included so the caller can pick out thin pools by type instead of
// guessing from the name. lv_size is the pool's data capacity, which is what
// data_percent is a percentage of.
const LVMThinFields = "vg_name,lv_name,segtype,lv_size,data_percent,metadata_percent,lv_attr"

// LVSThinReport lists every LV on the given hosts with its thin pool
// utilisation columns. vgName may be empty to cover all volume groups.
//
// data_percent and metadata_percent are blank for anything that is not a thin
// pool, and also for a thin pool that is not currently active — absence of
// information rather than zero, which the parser distinguishes.
