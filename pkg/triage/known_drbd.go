// ── 1. a peer slot nobody forgot ────────────────────────────────────────

// matchPhantomPeer finds a DRBD connection to a peer that is not a registered
// node.
//
// This is the quorum failure that reads as "the resource will not promote and
// every node looks fine". Removing a replica without `drbdadm forget-peer`
// leaves its slot in the metadata; the slot still counts toward the majority,
// so a two-node cluster needs three votes and can never have them. Nothing
// reports it as an error — the phantom simply sits in `Connecting` forever,
// which is also what a peer that is merely down looks like.
//
// The registry alone cannot tell a phantom from a replica on a host Haify never
// registered — a Proxmox node, say — that is merely powered off: both are
// unregistered and both sit in Connecting. Reading the first as the second
// told an operator to forget-peer a real, recoverable replica. The resource's
// own configuration settles it: a peer it names is a replica that is down; a
// peer it does not name is a leftover slot. When no node reported its
// configuration, the finding says it could not tell rather than guessing.
