// Restarting a service the promoter manages is not a restart of that service:
// reactor sees the unit stop, demotes the resource and another node promotes
// it, so the whole target moves and the control plane is gone for seconds.
// That is the single most common self-inflicted outage on this cluster, and it
// is invisible in the events alone — a failover event looks the same whether a
// node died or somebody typed systemctl restart.
//
// The pairing is what makes it identifiable, so this only fires when both
// halves are present within the window. Without the journal line it stays a
// plain failover event, reported by the generic grouping.
