// Reading how full a thin pool is, and deciding when that is worth saying out
// loud. Kept apart from the code that creates and extends pools so the parsing
// — where a wrong answer becomes a missed outage — can be read and tested on
// its own, the same way poolcachestatus.go is split from poolcache.go.
//
// Why this exists at all: almost all of a thin-backed group belongs to the
// thin pool LV — `pool create` gives it 95% of the free extents and
// convert-thin all of them — so vg_free stays near zero for the life of the
// pool. Capacity reported from the VG is therefore close to a constant, and
// says nothing about whether the next write will succeed.

// Thin pool utilisation thresholds, in percent.
//
// The gap between them is deliberate. A pool crossing ThinPoolNearFullPercent
// still has room to absorb ordinary writes, and the useful response is to plan
// an extension. Past ThinPoolFullPercent there may no longer be room for a
// full DRBD resync of the volumes it holds — a resync reallocates every block
// of a volume, so a pool that looks comfortable by delta can still be unable
// to survive one — and the useful response is immediate.
