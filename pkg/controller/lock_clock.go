// The clock locks are judged by.
//
// A snapshot or backup lock ends at a wall-clock time, so moving the wall
// clock forward — a spoofed NTP answer, a `date -s` — would end every lock at
// once, and the next delete would go through. Locks are therefore judged by
// lockNow: the wall time when the controller started, advanced by the
// monotonic clock, which a change of the system time does not move. A jump
// while the controller runs changes nothing about any lock, and is announced.
//
// What it does not cover: a controller started after the clock was moved
// takes that time as its start. Root on the controller host is outside what
// these locks defend against (snapshot_lock.go); the backups' own locks are
// kept by the object store's clock, not this one.

// lockClockStart carries a monotonic reading, so time.Since(lockClockStart)
// is immune to changes of the wall clock.
