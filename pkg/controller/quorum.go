// QuorumInfo is the vote arithmetic that decides whether a resource keeps
// serving as nodes are lost.
//
// It was previously reported nowhere. Working it out by hand needs two facts
// that are easy to get wrong: DRBD counts EVERY configured node — diskless
// tiebreakers and the off-site DR included — and the threshold is a strict
// majority of that total, not of the diskful replicas. The consequence is
// counter-intuitive: attaching a DR raises the majority from 2 to 3, which can
// cancel out the tiebreaker that was added to reach 2 in the first place.

	// Members is every node in the resource config.
	Members int
	// Required is the majority DRBD needs: Members/2 + 1.

	// Online is how many members the reporting node currently sees, itself
	// included.
	Online int
	// HasQuorum is what DRBD reports, not a recomputation of the fields above.
	// They can disagree while a connection is coming up, and DRBD is the one
	// that decides whether I/O proceeds.
