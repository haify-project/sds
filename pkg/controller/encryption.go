// LUKS encryption of a resource's BACKING volume — the layer beneath DRBD.
//
// The stack becomes DRBD → LUKS → LVM, which is where LINSTOR puts its `luks`
// layer too (see assertEncryptableStorage for why ZFS is left out). Two
// consequences follow from that ordering and both of them matter more than the
// code below:
//
//  1. DRBD sits ABOVE the crypt layer, so what travels between nodes is the
//     same plaintext it always was. This is encryption AT REST — it protects a
//     pool disk that leaves the building (RMA, decommission, theft), and it
//     protects nothing on the wire. An operator who turns this on believing the
//     replication link is now confidential has made a security mistake, so the
//     CLI help and both READMEs say so in as many words.
//  2. Every replica encrypts its own copy independently. There is no shared
//     ciphertext, so there is no reason for the replicas to share a key.
//
// # Key management
//
// Each node generates its own 512-bit key, on the node, from /dev/urandom, and
// keeps it at /etc/sds/luks/<container>.key — mode 0400, inside a 0700
// directory, both owned by root. The key never leaves the node it was made on,
// is never sent over SSH, never reaches the controller, and therefore cannot
// appear in the audit log, in the controller's log, or in the database.
//
// That last point is not a stylistic preference. In this codebase the only
// channel to a node is deployment.Exec, which (a) hands the whole command
// string to dispatch, which puts it in the remote sshd session's argv where any
// local user's `ps` can read it, and (b) logs it verbatim at Debug level on the
// controller. DistributeConfig is worse: it base64s the payload into that same
// command string and lands it as a 0644 file. Any design that ships a
// passphrase — a controller master key with per-resource derived subkeys, an
// operator-supplied passphrase, anything — has to travel that channel. Not
// having a secret to transport is the only version of this that is actually
// safe with the primitives that exist here. `cryptsetup` is therefore only ever
// handed --key-file, never a passphrase argument.
//
// What that costs, stated plainly: there is no central escrow. Losing a node's
// root filesystem loses that node's key and makes that node's copy of the
// ciphertext unrecoverable. That is survivable — the peers hold the same data
// under their own keys and DRBD rebuilds the replica — but it does mean this
// scheme cannot be used to recover data from a lone surviving disk whose node
// is gone. It also means the key sits on the same machine as the disks, so the
// threat this defends against is a departing DISK, not a departing SERVER.
//
// On `resource delete` each node's key file is overwritten and removed before
// the backing volume goes away, so the ciphertext left in unallocated pool
// extents has no key anywhere that could still read it.
//
// # Opening the container
//
// The container has to be open before DRBD can attach, on EVERY replica and not
// merely on the one being promoted: a Secondary receives replicated writes and
// therefore needs its backing device just as much as a Primary. A drbd-reactor
// promoter hook would be the wrong hook twice over — it runs only on the node
// being promoted, and it runs after DRBD is already up, which is too late.
//
// So the open belongs where the backing devices are already assembled at boot:
// sds-drbd-up.service, the node-local oneshot that runs `vgchange -ay` and then
// `drbdadm adjust` before drbd-reactor. luksBootOpenSnippet is spliced in
// between those two steps. That covers a reboot and, transitively, a failover:
// after any node comes back its containers are open and its replica reattaches,
// so drbd-reactor can promote it exactly as it would an unencrypted resource.

// luksKeyDir holds one key file and one device pointer per container. 0700 and
// root-owned: the mode is what keeps the keys out of reach of anything but
// root, and it is checked by the provisioning script rather than assumed.

// luksNameRe constrains the pool and volume names that are interpolated into a

// a future caller that has not.

// luksHeaderBytes is the space a LUKS2 header plus its keyslot area takes off
// the front of the device, and therefore how much bigger the backing volume has
// to be for the DRBD device to still be the size the user asked for. This is
// the same class of shortfall drbdMetadataBytes exists to absorb.
//
// cryptsetup's LUKS2 default data offset is 16 MiB. We reserve double that, so
// a node whose cryptsetup ships a larger keyslot area does not silently produce
