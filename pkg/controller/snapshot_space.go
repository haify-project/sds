// Retention counts snapshots; it does not look at the pool they fill. On a
// thin pool every snapshot holds the blocks written since it was taken, so a
// busy volume's history can outgrow the pool while staying well inside its
// policy. The pool fills, the next snapshot cannot be created, and retention,
// which is measured from the newest snapshot there is, stops removing
// anything: the pool stays full. The replica is what pays — its writes fail
// and DRBD drops the disk. That is what happened to one replica of a
// production resource, with the three other nodes at 79–90% on the same
// road.
//
// So after retention, a pool still past the near-full threshold gives up its
// oldest scheduled snapshots of the volume, one at a time, until it is below
// it. A snapshot is a convenience; the replica is the data.

// snapshotsKeptUnderPressure is how many of a volume's newest scheduled
// snapshots survive even a pool that stays full: removing the last ones would
// not free enough to matter and leaves nothing to restore from.

// relieveThinPool removes the volume's oldest scheduled snapshots on host
// while its thin pool is past ThinPoolNearFullPercent (data or metadata).
//
// Snapshots still inside the schedule's lock window are never removed
// (snapshot_lock.go): a pool filling fast is what ransomware rewriting a
// volume looks like, and the oldest snapshots are the clean ones. Every
// removal is announced, because history disappearing to make room is worth
// knowing about; and a pool that stays full once only locked snapshots are
// left raises a critical event, because its replica is next.
