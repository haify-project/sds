// Resources whose Primary another system decides.
//
// A drbd-reactor promoter — what `ha create` and every gateway write — makes a
// resource Primary on whichever replica it can and keeps it there. Some
// resources already have a manager deciding that:
//
//   - a Proxmox VM disk is made Primary by the storage plugin on the node PVE
//     starts the VM on, and moved by PVE live migration and PVE HA;
//   - a CSI volume is made Primary by the CSI node plugin on the node the pod
//     is scheduled to;
//   - a resource with diskless clients is used from nodes the promoter never
//     runs on (the Proxmox plugin attaches one where a VM runs without a local
//     replica).
//
// A promoter on any of them fights that manager for the role: it promotes a
// replica while the VM or pod runs elsewhere, or demotes the node it runs on
// when its own start chain fails. So both are refused up front.
