// Backups of encrypted resources.
//
// An encrypted volume's backing LV holds a LUKS2 header followed by ciphertext;
// DRBD sits above the crypt mapping and only ever sees plaintext. A backup
// snapshots the LV, so what it snapshots is the ciphertext. Reading that
// snapshot directly — which is what backups did until this file existed —
// stored the LUKS header plus the first DRBD-device-size bytes of ciphertext,
// and a restore wrote those bytes into the DRBD device, the plaintext layer.
// The result was a volume full of noise. Nor could the image be decrypted some
// other way: the key never leaves the node it was made on (encryption.go), and
// the image is short by the header's length.
//
// So the snapshot is read THROUGH a crypt mapping of its own: the snapshot of
// a LUKS volume carries the same header, so the node's key for that volume
// opens it, read-only, under a temporary name. The image is then the same
// plaintext DRBD holds, and it restores onto any replica — encrypted or not —
// because restores write through the DRBD device.
//
// The consequence, which the user guide states: an encrypted resource's backup
// is plaintext on the target. Encryption here protects departing pool disks;
// protecting the backup target is the target's job (bucket encryption, access
// policy). A ciphertext backup would need a key that outlives the node, which
// is precisely what this design refuses to create.

// backupSnapshotSource returns the shell that makes a backup snapshot readable,
// and the shell that undoes it on exit (":" when there is nothing to undo). The
// caller's script starts with MAP empty, so the cleanup is harmless if setup
// never got as far as opening anything.
//
// setup leaves $SRC naming the device to read and $OFF holding the byte offset,
// in the snapshot's own address space, of $SRC's first byte. For a plain volume
// that is the snapshot itself at offset 0. For an encrypted one it is a
// read-only crypt mapping of the snapshot, and $OFF is the LUKS data offset:
// thin_delta reports changed ranges of the LV, and every one of them has to be
// shifted by the header to address the same bytes in the plaintext.
