// rsDiscardGranularity is what a resource on thin storage resyncs with. A
// resync writes every block it covers, zeros included, so a full one — a new
// replica, an invalidate, a failback whose history no longer matches — turns a
// thin volume into a fully allocated one: 0.03% to 100% on a 1G volume on
// a test cluster, and the same thing is how a production thin pool filled
// up. With this set the sync source sends a run of zeros as a discard, and the
// target keeps it unallocated. DRBD rounds the value up to the backing
// device's discard granularity, and 64 KiB is the thin-pool chunk size LVM
// picks for all but very large pools.

// withThinResyncDefaults returns options with disk/rs-discard-granularity
// added when any volume is backed by thin storage and the caller did not set
// it. The caller's map is not modified. Thick volumes are left alone: on them
// a discard can reach a device that does not read back zeros afterwards.
