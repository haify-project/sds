// Storage tiering: an SSD in front of a slow LVM pool, via lvmcache. Reading
// the state of an existing cache lives in poolcachestatus.go; this file is the
// part that changes something.
//
// Three decisions shape the feature.
//
// 1. The cache is per pool, not per volume. SDS already treats a pool as the
//    unit an operator allocates from — resources name a pool, not an LV — and a
//    per-LV cache would have to be re-split by hand every time a resource is
//    added. LVM makes that cheap for a thin pool: caching the pool's data LV
//    puts every thin volume in the group behind the same SSD. It also means
//    only thin pools can be cached, because a thick pool has no single LV that
//    all its volumes pass through; AddPoolCache says so rather than picking a
//    volume on the operator's behalf.
//
// 2. writethrough by default, writeback only when asked for by name. See
//    normalizeCacheMode.
//
// 3. Every guard refuses. A device that already holds something, a pool that
//    already has a cache, a cache that cannot be flushed — none of these are
//    reconfigured into shape, because each one is a sign that the operator and
//    the cluster disagree about what that hardware is for.

	// thinPoolName. LVM renames it to "<name>_cvol" once it is attached.

	// minCacheDeviceBytes is the smallest device worth spending on a cache.
	//
	// Not a kernel limit — dm-cache will happily take less. It is the point
	// below which the cache stops paying for itself: LVM sizes the chunk to
	// keep the block count manageable, so a very small cache holds very few
	// distinct chunks, and a working set that does not fit thrashes at close to
	// the miss rate of no cache at all while still carrying every risk of one.

// normalizeCacheMode resolves the mode, defaulting to writethrough.
//
// writethrough acknowledges a write only once it has reached the slow device,
// so the SSD holds nothing that is not already durable. writeback acknowledges
// from the SSD and destages later, which means a node whose cache device fails
// — or a node that is destroyed outright — takes with it every write it had
// accepted but not yet written down, and only a replica that happens to hold
// those writes can give them back. DRBD makes that likely but not certain: a
