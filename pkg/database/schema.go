// The controller's entire inventory — nodes, pools, resources, volumes,
// gateways, HA configs, RBAC, audit trail, backup targets, notification
// channels — lives in one bbolt file on the metadata volume. Until this file
// existed, nothing on disk recorded which shape that inventory had been written
// in, so an upgrade simply opened whatever was there and hoped: a renamed
// bucket reads as absent, a changed struct field deserializes to its zero
// value, and neither is an error. The controller then reports a smaller or
// subtly different cluster than the one that exists, and the first write it
// makes bakes that in.
//
// Worse than an upgrade is a rollback. Reinstalling the previous binary is a
// routine, low-drama operation for an operator, and it is the one path where an
// older controller writes a database laid out by a newer one — silently
// dropping whatever the newer schema added. That is why the version check
// refuses to open a database from the future outright; it matters more than the
// migrations themselves.

// declared, none of which can be reconstructed from the storage nodes.

//
//   - The copy is taken only when a migration is actually going to run. Copying
//     on every start would double the write volume of a restart loop to protect
//     against nothing.
//   - The name carries the source version, not a timestamp, so an upgrade that
//     fails and is retried overwrites its own copy instead of filling the
//     volume with one file per attempt.
//   - It is written to a .partial name and renamed into place. A truncated copy
//     that looks like a restore point is worse than no restore point at all.
