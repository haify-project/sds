// rclone stores SMB/WebDAV passwords "obscured" and refuses a plain-text one
// outright, so a config we render has to carry the obscured form. Obscuring is
// AES-256-CTR under a key that ships inside every rclone binary, with the IV
// prepended and the whole thing base64url-encoded; rclone's own documentation
// is explicit that this is obfuscation, not encryption, and that anyone holding
// the config can reverse it. The real protection is the file's 0600 mode.
//
// Doing it here rather than shelling out to `rclone obscure` on the node is
// deliberate: the plain-text password would otherwise have to reach a command
// line, which is exactly what this whole path exists to avoid.
//
// If a future rclone were to change this encoding, the symptom would be an
// authentication failure against SMB/WebDAV only (S3 secrets are stored plain
// in rclone config and never go through here). TargetSpec.SecretIsObscured is
// the escape hatch: an operator can run `rclone obscure` themselves and pass
// the result through untouched.
