// ReplicaState is one replica's live DRBD state.
//
// The optional fields are pointers because their zero values are meaningful
// readings in their own right: 0% synced and "quorum lost" are both real
// states, and neither may be invented for a replica that simply did not report.
type ReplicaState struct {
	Resource string
	Node     string
	// Role, DiskState and ReplicationState are exported verbatim as label
	// values; an empty one is skipped rather than exported as "".

	DiskState        string
	ReplicationState string
	// SyncPercent is resync completion in 0..100, or nil when the status source
	// could not report it. Steady state is 100, not 0: drbdsetup omits the
	// completion field entirely once a resync has finished, and treating that
	// absence as zero paints a fully in-sync cluster as one whose resync never
	// started.
	SyncPercent *float64
	// Quorum is nil unless DRBD actually reported quorum for this replica,
	// which in practice is only the node that was queried — a node can only
	// speak for its own quorum, and inferring a peer's would be a guess.
	Quorum *bool
	// OutOfSyncBytes is how much DRBD has marked as differing from the node
	// whose status was read; zero for that node itself.
	OutOfSyncBytes uint64
	// TLS is nil for the node whose status was read, which has no connection
	// to itself, and otherwise whether the connection to this peer is
	// encrypted.
	TLS *bool
	// WrittenBytes is what DRBD wrote to this node's backing disk since the
	// resource came up there, or nil when it was not reported — only the node
	// whose status was read reports its own.
	WrittenBytes *uint64
}

// ReplicationSnapshot is one complete reading of DRBD replication.
type ReplicationSnapshot struct {
	// Resources is every resource the controller knows about, whether or not
	// any of its replicas could be read. Each becomes an sds_drbd_resource_up
	// series, which is how "nothing answered for this resource" is expressed:
	// its replica series simply do not exist, and resource_up is 0.
	Resources []string
	// Replicas is every replica whose state was actually read. Replicas that
	// could not be reached are absent, not zeroed — a node that has fallen off
	// the network must not read as a node reporting perfect health, nor as one
	// reporting total failure.
	Replicas []ReplicaState
}

// SetReplication replaces the whole DRBD replication view.
//
// DRBD's role, disk state and replication state are enumerations, and there are
// two usual ways to export one. This exports only the value currently held, as
// a series carrying that value as a label with a constant 1 — so
// `sds_drbd_disk_state{state!="UpToDate"} == 1` finds every unhealthy replica,
// and `count by (state)` gives the cluster's distribution.
//
// The alternative — a 0/1 series for every value of the enum — allows
// `{state="UpToDate"} == 0` as well, but costs roughly 25 series per replica
// instead of 3, and requires this package to hold a copy of DRBD's enums. Those
// enums differ across DRBD versions, so the copy would go stale silently and
// start dropping states that the kernel reports and this code has never heard
// of. Exporting exactly what drbdsetup said cannot go stale.
//
// A state that stops being current has its series deleted rather than set to 0,
// which is the same rule as everywhere else here: absent means "not observed".
