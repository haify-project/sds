// The diagnosis tool: read everything, then say what is wrong.
//
// The three observability tools next door each return one record, and an
// assistant asked "why did the cluster stop" has to call all three, guess a
// time window, notice that the failover event and the journal line four
// seconds later are the same story, and do it again for the node-side logs it
// cannot reach at all. In practice it does not: it calls one, finds a hundred
// lines, and answers from whichever of them was most recent.
//
// This tool does the reading and the correlating, and returns problems instead
// of lines. What it will not do is decide what to say — a finding it cannot
// show the line for is not returned, and only the failure modes Haify actually
// knows the cause of carry a cause and steps. The rest arrives as grouped
// evidence for the model to reason over, which is the honest division: the
// deterministic part is deterministic and the judgement is visibly judgement.
