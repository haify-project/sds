# SDS user guide

This is the day-to-day guide: how to think about SDS, and how to carry out the
things you will actually do with it. It assumes a cluster that is already up —
see [deployment-guide.md](deployment-guide.md) to build one and
[node-prerequisites.md](node-prerequisites.md) for what each node needs
installed.

Every command here is `sds`, which talks to the controller over gRPC on
port 3374. The same operations are available in the web UI and, for AI
assistants, through [`sds-mcp`](mcp.md).

## 1. The mental model

Four things, stacked:

```
node          a Linux machine SDS reaches over SSH
 └─ pool      an LVM volume group or ZFS pool on that node's disks
     └─ resource   a replicated block device: the same bytes on several nodes
         └─ volume     one block device inside the resource (usually just one)
```

A **resource** is the unit that matters. It is a DRBD device: you write to it on
one node and the bytes land on every replica synchronously. One replica is
**Primary** (mounted, writable); the others are **Secondary** (receiving, not
mountable). Exactly one node may be Primary at a time — that is what stops two
machines from writing to the same filesystem and destroying it.

Three ideas explain most of SDS's behaviour:

**Quorum.** A replica set decides by majority who is allowed to serve I/O. Two
diskful replicas cannot form a majority when one is lost, so SDS adds a third
member with no disk — a **tiebreaker** — that votes but stores nothing. Without
it, losing either node suspends I/O on both.

**Promotion is automatic, by drbd-reactor.** You do not usually run `primary`
yourself. You declare what should run with the resource (a mount, a virtual IP,
some services) and drbd-reactor promotes a node and starts them, moving the
whole set elsewhere if that node dies. See [High availability](#11-high-availability).

**Snapshots, replicas and backups are three different things**, and only one of
them is a backup:

| | Protects against | Does not protect against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replica | Losing a machine | `rm -rf` — it replicates |
| Snapshot | `rm -rf` | Losing the pool it lives in |
| Backup | Losing the whole cluster | Nothing else, if it is verified |

---

## 2. Talking to the cluster

```bash
sds node list                          # against 127.0.0.1:3374
sds -c 192.0.2.250:3374 node list      # against a remote controller
```

With Self-HA enabled the controller moves between nodes; point `-c` at the
floating VIP rather than at a node, so it never goes stale:

```bash
sds ha self status                     # prints the VIP and the active node
sds -c 192.0.2.250:3374 node list      # 192.0.2.250 = that VIP
```

If the cluster has RBAC or token auth on, supply a token with `--token`, the
`SDS_TOKEN` environment variable, or a file at `~/.sds/token` or
`/etc/sds/token` (checked in that order).

If the controller serves TLS, connect with `--tls`, adding `--tls-ca` when its
certificate is not signed by a CA in the system trust store, and
`--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` when it requires client certificates. Each flag has an
environment variable (`SDS_TLS`, `SDS_TLS_CA`, `SDS_TLS_CERT`, `SDS_TLS_KEY`,
`SDS_TLS_SERVER_NAME`, `SDS_TLS_INSECURE`).

Commands that change state on the nodes wait minutes for the controller (most
up to 10, backups and pool rebuilds longer); listings and status give up after
30 seconds. A command that gives up may still be completed by the controller,
so check with the matching `list` or `status` before running it again.

Two commands worth knowing before anything else:

```bash
sds health-check          # can the controller reach every node, and is the stack installed
sds resource status <name>  # everything about one resource: roles, disks, replication
```

---

## 3. Nodes

```bash
sds node register --name node1 --address 192.0.2.11
sds node list
sds node get node1
```

`--address` is the management IP SDS uses for SSH. If replication should run
over a different network — a dedicated 10G link, say — name it separately:

```bash
sds node register --name node1 --address 192.0.2.11 \
    --replication-address 10.0.0.11
```

**Labels** describe where a node physically is. Auto-placement uses them to keep
replicas apart, or together:

```bash
sds node label node1 rack=A zone=east
sds node label node1 rack=          # trailing = deletes the label
sds node label node1 zone=west --replace   # drop every other label
```

`sds.tiebreaker=false` keeps a node from ever being picked as a resource's
quorum tiebreaker — set it on an off-site DR node, which is not on the
replication network.

**Renumbering** a node — its IP changed, or it moved subnet — is one command
once the node answers on the new address:

```bash
sds node set-address node1 192.0.2.21
sds node set-address node1 192.0.2.21 --replication-address 10.0.0.21
```

It checks the new address reaches the same machine, then moves the node in the
registry, rewrites its entry in every node's `/etc/hosts`, and rewrites the
DRBD config of each resource it takes part in; each reconnects on the new
address.

When several nodes changed address — a DHCP server handed every node a new
lease — renumber them in **one** command. One at a time cannot work then: each
node's resources would be rewritten through peers the controller still knows
only by their old addresses, and when two nodes trade addresses the configs
pass through a state with both on one.

```bash
sds node set-address node1=192.0.2.21 node2=192.0.2.22 node3=192.0.2.23
```

If every node moved, the controller cannot start at all: its database lives on
a DRBD resource whose peers can no longer find each other. Bring that one
resource back by hand first — map old to new in a single pass, since a plain
chain of `sed` substitutions breaks when two nodes trade addresses:

```bash
# on every node, with each node's old → new address
perl -pi -e 'my %m = ("192.0.2.11" => "192.0.2.21", "192.0.2.12" => "192.0.2.22",
                      "192.0.2.13" => "192.0.2.23");
             s/\b(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)(?=:)/exists $m{$1} ? $m{$1} : $1/ge' /etc/drbd.d/sds-meta.res
drbdadm adjust sds-meta
# once the controller is up on its VIP:
sds node set-address node1=192.0.2.21 node2=192.0.2.22 node3=192.0.2.23
```

`resource repair <resource>` also writes the registry's addresses into a
resource's config, so a resource a renumbering could not reach (a node was
down) is fixed by repairing it afterwards.

**Draining** a node marks it `maintenance` and moves every resource that is
Primary there to another replica — do this before maintenance, not after:

```bash
sds node drain node1
# ... reboot, replace a disk, upgrade ...
sds node undrain node1
```

A `maintenance` node gets no new replicas or tiebreakers (`resource create`,
CSI provisioning) and keeps that state through health checks and
re-registration until `undrain`. Undrain moves nothing back.

How each Primary moves:

- **HA resources, gateways, sds-meta** go through drbd-reactor's eviction,
  the same as `sds ha evict`; drbd-reactor picks the new node.
- **Everything else** is demoted, then promoted on the first replica in the
  resource's node list that is diskful, `UpToDate`, connected, and neither
  drained, offline, nor a WAN resource's DR node. If that promote fails, the
  original node is promoted back.

A resource that cannot move — no qualifying replica, a mounted volume, a
failed eviction — stays Primary where it is; the drain moves the rest and
names each one it left, with the reason. The node stays drained either way.

Unregistering is for a node that is never coming back:

```bash
sds node unregister node4
```

It refuses while anything still uses the node, and names each resource and its
role there:

```
node node4 is still in use by: data (replica, NFS gateway); logs (tiebreaker); move or remove these first
```

Clear each role first: a replica with `resource remove-replica`, a tiebreaker
with `ha set-tiebreaker` (move it, or `--remove`), a diskless client with
`resource diskless detach`, a gateway with `gateway delete`. A WAN resource's
DR node can only be released by deleting that resource. Once nothing is left,
unregistering removes the node from the registry; it does not touch the node.

---

## 4. Pools

A pool is the storage a node contributes. Three kinds (and a fourth, thin on
VDO, below):

```bash
sds pool create --name data-pool --type lvm      --nodes node1,node2 --devices /dev/sdb
sds pool create --name thin-pool --type lvm-thin --nodes node1,node2 --devices /dev/sdc
sds pool create --name tank      --type zfs      --nodes node1,node2 --devices /dev/sdd
sds pool list
sds pool get --name thin-pool --node node1
```

On the nodes the volume group (or zpool) is named with an `sds_` prefix —
`thin-pool` becomes `sds_thin-pool`. Commands accept either form except
`pool convert-thin`, which takes the prefixed name.

A ZFS pool compresses: OpenZFS 2.2 and later default to `lz4`.
`--compression <algorithm>` (`zstd`, `zstd-3`, `gzip-6`, `off`, ...) and
`--dedup` set it on the pool's root dataset at creation, so every volume
inherits it; dedup costs RAM on every write and only pays off for data known to
repeat. `pool get` (and the MCP pool listing) report the algorithm and the ratio
ZFS achieves (`Compression: zstd, 1.85x achieved`). Encrypted resources are LVM
only, so ciphertext — which does not compress — never lands on a ZFS pool.

Omitting `--type` gives the controller's `[storage] default_pool_type`, which
is `thin_pool` unless changed. **Choose thin unless you have a reason not to.**
A thick (plain `lvm`) pool cannot hold a useful snapshot history: LVM makes every thick snapshot reserve
its copy-on-write area up front, so a 10 GiB pool backing a 6 GiB volume fits
two snapshots whether or not anything ever changes. A thin snapshot costs only
the blocks that diverge.

Converting later is possible but is a rebuild, one node at a time:

```bash
sds pool convert-thin --node node1 --pool sds_data-pool
```

It destroys that node's copy and resyncs it in full from the peers. The resource
keeps serving throughout — the node goes diskless for the duration. It refuses
to start if the node holds a Primary, if a peer is not `UpToDate`, if a resync
is already running, or if this is one of only two diskful copies.

Growing a pool:

```bash
sds pool add --pool data-pool --nodes node1 --devices /dev/sde
```

The disk joins the volume group. If the group holds a thin pool, that pool is
then extended into 95% of the group's free space (the same share `pool create`
uses), with its metadata area grown in proportion first, so thin volumes can
use the new disk straight away.

Deleting a pool is per node, and an LVM pool that still holds any volume is
refused; the freed disks have their PV labels wiped:

```bash
sds pool delete --name data-pool --node node1
```

**Thin pools on VDO (`--type lvm-thin-vdo`).** The thin pool's data area sits
on a VDO volume, so everything written to it is deduplicated and compressed;
thin volumes, thin snapshots and DRBD above it behave as on a plain thin pool.
It suits data that repeats — VM images built from the same template, backups,
logs.

```bash
sds pool create --name dedup --type lvm-thin-vdo --nodes node1,node2 --devices /dev/sdf
```

Each node needs the dm-vdo kernel module (kernel 6.9 or later, or kmod-kvdo on
EL), `vdoformat` from the `vdo` package, and lvm2 2.03.24 or later
(`--pooldatavdo`); `pool create` checks for all three before it touches the
disk. Ubuntu 24.04's GA kernel does not ship dm-vdo — use the HWE kernel.

What to know before choosing it:

- **Physical space is the figure to watch.** The thin pool's usage is the
  logical space handed out; the VDO pool under it fills at whatever rate
  dedup and compression leave. When VDO runs out of physical space, writes
  fail with I/O errors although the thin pool still shows room — and DRBD
  drops the disk. `pool get` shows both (`VDO: 41% physical used, 63% saved`),
  and `pool.vdo_physical_near_full` / `pool.vdo_physical_full` fire at the
  same thresholds as the thin pool alerts.
- **It deduplicates per node.** VDO is under DRBD, so DRBD replicates every
  logical block in full; it saves disk on each node, not network.
- **No encryption.** An encrypted resource is refused on a VDO pool:
  ciphertext neither deduplicates nor compresses.
- **Deleted snapshots do not give space back to VDO** on current lvm2 (the thin
  pool does not pass the discard down); the space is reused for new writes
  inside the pool, but VDO's physical usage does not drop.
- **Growing is by hand.** `pool add` adds the disk to the group but does not
  grow the pool: extend the VDO pool's physical size first, then the thin
  pool's logical size, in the ratio you expect dedup to achieve.
- VDO costs memory (roughly 1 GB per TB of physical space for its index and
  block map, more with a larger index) and CPU on every write.

This is new in SDS; validate it on your hardware and kernel before production.

An SSD or NVMe cache in front of a thin pool (`pool add-cache`,
`pool remove-cache`) is covered in [Storage tiering](#13-storage-tiering).

**Quotas.** A thin pool admits volumes as long as it has room for what is
already written, so it can promise many times what it holds. `[quota]
max_overcommit_ratio` caps that: a new resource, replica, volume or resize that
would take a node's thin pool past that many times its real size (the sum of
its thin volumes, snapshots not counted) is refused there, and auto-placement
passes the node over. 0, the default, leaves thin pools unlimited.

Projects are resources sharing a label (`project=<name>` by default,
`[quota] project_label`). A project's quota caps the total size of its
resources — counted once each, as asked for, not per replica — and their
number:

```toml
[quota]
max_overcommit_ratio = 3.0
[[quota.projects]]
name = "team-a"
max_gb = 2000
max_resources = 50
```

```bash
sds resource create --name a1 --size 100G --label project=team-a ...
```

---

## 5. Resources — your storage

The minimum:

```bash
sds resource create --name db --size 100G --port 7000 --nodes node1,node2
```

That creates a 100 GiB replicated device on two nodes, adds a diskless
tiebreaker on a third if one is available, and brings it up, Secondary on every
node. Each resource needs its own **port** (7000+ by convention; it must be free
on every node). Without `--pool` the volume goes into a pool named `data-pool`.

The tiebreaker is added only to a resource with exactly two diskful replicas,
never to a WAN resource, and only while `[resource] auto_tiebreaker` is on (the
default). With no spare node the resource is created without one and
`resource list` marks it `⚠quorum-risk`.

**Placement.** Omit `--nodes` and SDS picks by free space:

```bash
sds resource create --name db --size 100G --port 7000 --replicas 2
sds resource create --name db --size 100G --port 7000 --replicas 3 \
    --replicas-on-same zone --do-not-place-with web
```

`--replicas-on-same zone` keeps every replica in one zone (latency);
`--do-not-place-with web` keeps this resource off the nodes `web` uses
(anti-affinity); `--replicas-on-different rack` gives each replica a different
`rack` value. All three take a label key, are repeatable, and apply only when
`--nodes` is omitted. Placement considers only online nodes that host the
requested pool and have room for the volume in it.

**Fault domains.** Nodes that fail together — VMs on one physical host, servers
in one rack — should not hold two copies of the same data. Tell SDS which
nodes share a machine with a `host` label:

```bash
sds node label node1 host=hv1
sds node label node2 host=hv1
sds node label node3 host=hv2
```

Automatic placement, `resource profile adjust` and the CSI driver then put
replicas on different hosts before they look at free space, and the quorum
tiebreaker goes to a host none of the replicas is on — a tiebreaker beside a
replica falls with it and takes the survivor's quorum along. `add-replica` uses
the node you name and does not check the label. When the cluster cannot spread
(all VMs on one machine), the resource is still created and the CLI prints a
warning. `resource list` flags every resource where losing one host would lose
all copies or the quorum majority: `⚠one-failure-domain(host=hv1)`.

The label key is `[resource] fault_domain_label` in `controller.toml` (default
`host`; a StorageClass sets its own with `faultDomainLabel`). A node without
the label counts as its own domain, so an unlabelled cluster places exactly as
before. `--replicas-on-different host` makes the spread a hard requirement.

**Profiles** group resources that should be alike. A resource created with
`--profile` — or attached later — is a member, and what is set on the profile
reaches every member:

```bash
sds resource profile create --name db-tier --pool thin-pool --protocol C --replicas 2 \
    --replicas-on-different host --drbd-options net/max-buffers=4000
sds resource create --name db --size 100G --port 7000 --profile db-tier
sds resource set-profile legacy-db db-tier      # attach an existing resource
sds resource list --profile db-tier             # the members
sds resource profile get db-tier                # settings and members

# one change, every member: saved on the profile, applied to each resource
sds resource profile set-options db-tier --drbd-options net/max-buffers=8000

# after raising --replicas, or for a member attached with fewer copies:
sds resource profile adjust db-tier --dry-run   # what would change
sds resource profile adjust db-tier             # apply options, add missing replicas

sds resource profile max-size db-tier           # largest volume a new member could get
sds resource profile list
sds resource profile delete db-tier
```

A flag given to `resource create` overrides the profile's value for that
resource. `adjust` applies the profile's DRBD options to every member and adds
replicas where the profile asks for more, placed by its pool and label
constraints. It never removes one: a member with more copies than the
profile is reported and left alone. A profile with members cannot be deleted;
take them out first with `resource set-profile <resource> --none`.

**DRBD options** can be set at creation or changed later:

```bash
sds resource create --name db ... --drbd-options on-no-quorum=suspend-io
sds resource set-options db --drbd-options disk/c-max-rate=200M,net/max-buffers=8000
```

Keys take the form `section/key`; a bare key goes to the resource-level
`options` section, so `on-no-quorum` needs no prefix but a `net` or `disk`
option does. `disk/` options go into every volume, both at creation and with
`set-options`. `set-options` rewrites the config on every node and runs
`drbdadm adjust`.

**Labels** on a resource (`--label app=postgres`, repeatable) are free-form tags
shown by `resource list`; a profile can carry default labels.

**Storage type** follows the pool automatically for LVM — a thin pool gets a
thin volume without your having to say so. ZFS is the exception and must be
named: `--storage-type zfs`.

---

## 6. Using a resource

A fresh resource is a raw block device, Secondary everywhere. Promote it on one
node, put a filesystem on it there and mount it:

```bash
sds resource primary db node1                       # <resource> <node>
sds resource fs db 0 ext4 --node node1              # <resource> <volume-id> <fstype>
sds resource mount db 0 /mnt/db --node node1        # <resource> <volume-id> <mount-path>
```

Volume ids start at 0. A single-volume resource is always volume `0`. `fs` runs
`mkfs.<fstype>` on `/dev/drbd/by-res/<resource>/<volume-id>` (without `--node`,
on the current Primary). `mount` creates the mount path and mounts the device;
it does not add an fstab entry, so the mount does not survive a reboot.

To give it back:

```bash
sds resource unmount db 0 --node node1
sds resource secondary db node1
```

`promote`/`demote` are the same as `primary`/`secondary`; `primary --force`
promotes a node whose data DRBD does not consider up to date.

For anything that should survive a node dying, do **not** mount it by hand —
declare it as HA instead and let drbd-reactor do the mounting. See
[High availability](#11-high-availability).

To see what you have:

```bash
sds resource list
sds resource get db         # port, protocol, nodes, tiebreaker, volumes, profile, labels
sds resource status db      # roles, disk states, replication, per node
```

Read `status` like this: exactly one node should be `Primary`, every node's disk
should be `UpToDate`, and replication should be `Established`. Anything else is
covered in [When something is wrong](#20-when-something-is-wrong).

**Diskless clients** let a node mount a resource without storing a copy — it
reads and writes over the DRBD network:

```bash
sds resource diskless attach db node3
sds resource primary db node3        # after unmounting and demoting elsewhere
sds resource mount db 0 /mnt/db --node node3
# ... later: unmount and demote on node3, then
sds resource diskless detach db node3
```

Useful for a compute node that needs the data but has no disks to spare. It is
still bound by the one-Primary-at-a-time rule. Attaching the node that is the
resource's tiebreaker turns it into a client; it keeps its quorum vote.

**Dual-primary** exists for one job: live-migrating a VM, when the source and
target hypervisor both hold the disk open during the hand-off.

```bash
sds resource dual-primary db on
sds resource dual-primary db off
```

It is not a way to use one volume from two machines — an ordinary filesystem
mounted twice is corrupted. WAN resources are refused. The setting is
runtime-only: a reboot or `drbdadm adjust` returns the resource to
single-primary.

**Deleting** a resource removes its HA configuration and any gateway on it
first, unmounts it, takes it down on every node, and deletes its backing
volumes. It does not ask for confirmation:

```bash
sds resource delete db
```

There is no force option, and none is needed: a node that fails to take the
resource down, or a backing volume that cannot be removed, does not stop the
delete. Each is logged as a warning in the controller log, and a volume left
behind has to be removed on its node by hand (`lvremove` or `zfs destroy`).

---

## 7. Changing a resource's shape

All of these run on a live resource.

```bash
# more capacity: <resource> <volume-id> <size>. Refused when a replica's pool
# cannot hold the growth: the new area is written to every replica, and a full
# thin pool drops the disk (--ignore-free-space overrides).
sds resource resize-volume db 0 200G

# another local replica (refused if the node's pool has less free space than
# the volume: the sync writes all of it; --ignore-free-space overrides)
sds resource add-replica db --node node3

# take one out; the node's volume for it is deleted
sds resource remove-replica db --node node3 --yes

# more volumes in the same resource (--volume is the backing volume's name in
# the pool); remove-volume takes the volume id
sds resource add-volume db --volume db_logs --size 50G --pool thin-pool
sds resource remove-volume db 1
```

A resource's promoters — its `ha create` config and its gateway — follow the
replicas. `add-replica` first checks that the new node could run them (the OCF
agents and services the chain starts, the gateway's tools) and refuses
otherwise; once the replica is in, it gets a copy of each, plus the mount unit
an HA config starts, so it can take over as soon as it is UpToDate.
`remove-replica` retires them from the node that left. Nodes that already
hold a promoter are never rewritten, since on the node running the service a
rewrite and reload restarts it. A WAN resource's DR node never gets one.

`remove-replica` is refused when the node is Primary, when it is the
tiebreaker or the off-site DR node, or when fewer than two diskful copies would
remain. It stops the resource on the leaving node first, then rewrites the
config on every node and adjusts the survivors, so every node must be
reachable (for a node that never will be, see `--lost` below); if a step fails it stops with an error and the registry still lists
the replica. After a failed removal, check that every node's
`/etc/drbd.d/<resource>.res` agrees:

```bash
# on each node
md5sum /etc/drbd.d/db.res
```

Mismatched files mean one node has a stale view — copy the correct one over and
`drbdadm adjust db`. Removal also frees the leaver's bitmap slot on the
survivors (`drbdsetup forget-peer`), which an add-replica later needs.

**A node that is gone for good.** A normal removal has to reach the leaving
node. When it never will, use `--lost`:

```bash
sds resource remove-replica db --node node3 --lost --yes
```

Nothing runs on node3. The survivors (and the tiebreaker and clients) get the
config without it, are adjusted, and forget its slot; the registry drops it.
It is refused while node3 answers over SSH, while any survivor is still
connected to it over DRBD (cut off from the controller is not gone), and
unless the survivors still hold quorum and an UpToDate copy without it. One
remaining diskful copy is enough, since node3's is already lost — add a
replica afterwards. node3 keeps its volume and its old config: if it ever
comes back, run `drbdadm down db` there and delete
`/etc/drbd.d/db.res`, its `sds-*-db.toml` promoters and its volume before it
rejoins anything.

If the survivors lost quorum with it — two replicas and no tiebreaker — give
them one first: `sds ha set-tiebreaker db <node>` works with a member that is
gone (no SSH, and no survivor connected to it), skipping it. Then remove it
with `--lost`.

`resource repair <resource>` rewrites the config on every participant —
replicas, tiebreaker, diskless clients — so they agree on the volumes and the
registry's node addresses, then runs `drbdadm adjust`. Use it when a tiebreaker
or client of a multi-volume resource stays `Connecting` and its kernel log says
a packet arrived "for volume N, which is not configured locally". It then puts
the resource's promoters on exactly its primary-site replicas, as
`add-replica` does: use it after an older version added or removed a replica,
or gave a DR node a promoter.

**Adopting** an existing DRBD resource that SDS did not create:

```bash
sds resource adopt legacy-vol --nodes node1,node2
```

Adopting reads the live `/etc/drbd.d/<name>.res` and records what it finds; it
never changes the resource or its data. `--nodes` and `--port` are read from
the config when omitted; `--protocol` defaults to C.

**Tiebreakers** can be moved if the node holding one is going away. The change
is config-only: nothing resyncs and a promoted resource keeps serving.

```bash
sds ha set-tiebreaker db --node node4
sds ha set-tiebreaker db --remove       # drop it, accepting the quorum risk
```

**Adding a replica while a member is away.** `add-replica` rewrites every
member's config, so a member that does not answer refuses it. With
`--allow-unreachable` it goes ahead on the members that answer, as long as
they are the majority; the ones that were away are recorded and get the new
config (a `resource repair`) as soon as they answer again.

**Moving a replica** adds the new one, waits until it is UpToDate and only then
removes the old one, so the resource is never a copy short. It returns once
the new replica is added; the removal follows by itself, and resumes after a
controller restart or failover. A Primary is not moved: drain the node first.

```bash
sds resource move-replica db --from node2 --to node4
```

**Rebalancing** is by plan, never on its own: each move is a full sync (1 TB
takes tens of minutes on 10GbE, hours on 1GbE). The plan moves replicas off
the node holding the most allocated capacity to nodes that hold less, until
the spread is within a tenth of the mean, and leaves out the controller's
metadata, WAN resources and CSI volumes (a PersistentVolume's node affinity is
fixed when it is created), saying so.

```bash
sds rebalance                  # the plan; nothing changes
sds rebalance --apply          # run it, one move at a time
```

**Preferred nodes** for an HA resource order where drbd-reactor starts it:
each node waits a little longer the further down the list it is. With
`--policy start-only` (drbd-reactor 1.9+) the order only picks where it
starts; `always` also moves it back to a more preferred node that returns,
which is a failover of its own. It is a preference, not a fence: DRBD quorum,
not this, is what prevents split brain.

```bash
sds ha set-preferred db --nodes node1,node2 --policy start-only
```

### Self-healing

A node that dies leaves every resource it held a copy of one replica short.
With `[self_heal] auto_evict = "on"` the controller replaces those replicas
itself, and with `"dry-run"` it decides the same and only says what it would
do (`node.evicted` events). It acts only when all of this holds:

- the node has been offline for `after_minutes` (default 60; the time is kept
  across controller failovers, and `sds node list` shows it);
- at most `max_offline_percent` (default 34) of the nodes are offline, and the
  controller reaches a majority — otherwise it may be the one cut off;
- for each resource, the `--lost` guard above: the node does not answer over
  SSH, no surviving member is connected to it over DRBD, and the survivors
  hold quorum and an UpToDate copy;
- the node is not drained and not labelled `sds.io/auto-evict=false`, and the
  resource is not the controller's own metadata, not WAN-replicated and not
  labelled `sds.io/auto-evict=false`.

It replaces one replica at a time and waits for its sync before the next. The
new replica goes where placement would put it. When the node holds no replica
any more it is **evicted**: it gets no new replicas, and when it comes back it
still holds old configs and volumes. Then:

```bash
sds node restore node3 --dry-run   # what would be deleted on it
sds node restore node3             # delete it, and let it take replicas again
sds node lost node3                # or: it is not coming back
```

`node restore` takes down, on that node only, every resource it is no longer a
member of, and deletes its config, promoter configs and the volumes sds named
after it. `node lost` removes every replica the node still holds the `--lost`
way and keeps it evicted. Both are on the two-person approval list.

---

## 8. Snapshots

Snapshots live in the same pool as the resource. They are instant and cheap on a
thin pool, and they are **not a backup** — losing the pool loses both.

```bash
sds resource snapshot create --resource db --name before-upgrade
sds resource snapshot list --resource db
sds resource snapshot restore --resource db --name before-upgrade
sds resource snapshot delete --resource db --name before-upgrade
```

A manual snapshot is taken on **one node** — `--node`, by default the
resource's first replica — of volume 0's backing volume, in the resource's own
pool (`--pool` overrides). Use the same `--node` for `list`, `restore` and
`delete`. On a thin volume it is a thin snapshot; on a thick one it reserves a
copy-on-write area of `--size` (default `1G`). A ZFS resource needs
`--storage-type zfs` on each of these commands.

`restore` is refused while the resource is Primary anywhere. Unmount and demote
it first; a gateway is stopped with `gateway stop`, and an `ha create` resource
needs `ha delete` before the unmount, or drbd-reactor promotes it again. It
takes the resource down on every node, merges the snapshot back on its node,
and makes every other replica resync that volume from it; until the resync
finishes there is one complete copy.

**Snapshots of the whole resource.** `snapshot create` snapshots one node.
A replicated snapshot is taken of every volume on every diskful replica at
once, with I/O suspended across them for the moment it takes (a systemd timer
on each node resumes it after a minute whatever happens to the controller):

```bash
sds resource snapshot replicated create   --resource db --name before-upgrade
sds resource snapshot replicated list     --resource db
sds resource snapshot replicated rollback --resource db --name before-upgrade
sds resource snapshot replicated delete   --resource db --name before-upgrade
```

Each copy carries its replica's DRBD metadata, so a rollback — which needs the
resource Secondary everywhere — restores every replica together and resyncs
nothing. The backing snapshots are named `<backing>_snap_<name>`. The Proxmox
plugin takes VM snapshots this way. Encrypted resources are snapshotted volume
by volume.

**Exact sizes and renaming.** `resource create --size 10737418752 --exact-size`
makes the device exactly that many bytes (rounded up to a 512-byte sector)
instead of whole GiB; the backing volume is still allocated in GiB and the
DRBD device capped. A resize keeps it exact. `sds resource rename <old> <new>`
renames a resource that is not Primary anywhere and that no HA config,
gateway, schedule, backup or snapshot refers to.

**Scheduled snapshots** with grandfather-father-son retention:

```bash
sds resource snapshot schedule create --resource db \
    --cron "0 * * * *" \
    --keep-hourly 24 --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 6

sds resource snapshot schedule list
sds resource snapshot schedule delete --resource db
```

A resource has at most one schedule; `create` on a resource that already has one
replaces it (`--disabled` saves it without running it). Each run snapshots
every volume of the resource on every diskful node, named
`<backing-volume>_sched_<UTC timestamp>`.

The cron field is standard 5-field syntax. Retention is applied after each run,
to that node's scheduled snapshots of that volume only — manual snapshots are
never touched. Each tier keeps the newest snapshot in each of its most recent
periods: `--keep-hourly 24` keeps one per hour for the last 24 hours that have
one, `--keep-daily 7` one per day, and so on through `--keep-yearly`. A
snapshot any tier keeps survives. A policy of all zeros keeps everything.
Deleting a schedule keeps the snapshots it already made.

Retention counts snapshots; it does not look at the pool. On a thin pool each
snapshot holds the blocks written since it was taken, so a busy volume's
history can fill the pool while staying inside its policy — and a full pool
fails the replica's own writes. So after retention, if the pool is still past
85% (data or metadata), the scheduler removes that volume's oldest scheduled
snapshots on that node one at a time until it is below, always keeping the
newest two. It logs each one it removes and raises a `pool.snapshots_removed`
event.

**Locked snapshots.** That near-full rule removes the *oldest* snapshots — and
a volume being encrypted by ransomware rewrites every block, so it is exactly
what fills a thin pool fast, and the oldest snapshots are the clean ones from
before the attack. A schedule can lock what it takes:

```bash
sds resource snapshot schedule create --resource db \
    --cron "0 * * * *" --keep-hourly 24 --keep-daily 7 --lock-days 14
```

Until a scheduled snapshot is `--lock-days` old (measured from the time in its
name), sds does not delete it — not retention, not the near-full rule, not
`snapshot delete`, and not a ZFS `restore` that would roll back past it. While
any snapshot of the resource is locked, the schedule cannot be deleted, the
resource or one of its volumes cannot be deleted (not even with `--force`), and
the lock can be raised but not lowered. Replacing the schedule without
`--lock-days` keeps its lock. Restoring a locked LVM thin snapshot merges it
and takes it again under the same name, so its lock is unchanged; a locked
thick snapshot cannot be restored until its lock passes. The limit is 365 days.

On ZFS, each locked snapshot also carries a `sds-lock` hold, so `zfs destroy`
on the node — a cleanup script, a `zfs destroy -r` of the dataset — fails too
until sds releases the hold when the lock has passed. Root can `zfs release`
it; it guards against mistakes, not against root.

Locks are judged by the time the controller has counted since it started, not
by the system clock: moving the clock forward (a `date -s`, a spoofed NTP
answer) to end the locks early changes nothing, and raises a
`controller.clock_jumped` event.

The cost is space: size the pool for `--lock-days` of change. A pool past the
near-full line with nothing left but locked snapshots is not relieved; it
raises a critical `pool.snapshots_locked` event, and if it fills, that
replica's writes fail. And the lock binds sds and its API, not root on a
storage node, who can `lvremove` anything — for that, back up to a target with
S3 Object Lock (see [Backups](#9-backups--the-only-copy-that-survives-losing-the-cluster)).

**Freezing a schedule.** A frozen schedule keeps taking snapshots but removes
none — not by retention, not to relieve a full pool — and every scheduled
snapshot of the resource is locked until the freeze ends: it cannot be deleted
through sds, nor the schedule or resource deleted. A freeze can be extended,
not shortened, except by `unfreeze`, which needs a second person under
[two-person approval](#16-access-control).

```bash
sds resource snapshot schedule freeze --resource db --hours 72 --reason "investigating"
sds resource snapshot schedule unfreeze --resource db
```

**Write anomalies.** Encrypting a volume rewrites it as fast as the disks
allow. With `[alert] enabled`, the health poll reads how much DRBD wrote to the
answering node's disk (also exported as `sds_drbd_written_bytes`), and each
resource learns its usual write rate, overall and by hour of the week; resync
traffic is left out. Once it has learned (30 normal polls), a rate
`[alert.write_anomaly] factor` times the usual (default 5) and at least
`min_mbps` (default 20 MB/s), on two polls in a row, raises a critical
`resource.write_anomaly`, freezes the resource's schedule for `freeze_hours`
(default a week) and takes a snapshot right away. It resolves after three
normal polls; the freeze stays until it ends or is lifted.

It reports a rate, not an attack: a bulk import, a reindex or a restore look
the same, and are what `unfreeze` is for. Encryption throttled to look normal
does not trip it. It needs a snapshot schedule on the resource to have
anything to freeze.

Schedules live in the controller database and survive a restart or a failover —
the node that becomes active picks them up.

## 9. Backups — the only copy that survives losing the cluster

A backup is a compressed image of a resource shipped somewhere SDS cannot reach
from the cluster. Targets are S3-compatible object stores, SMB shares, or WebDAV.
The node that reads a backup runs `rclone` to talk to the target, so install it
on every storage node (`apt install rclone`); a node without it is refused
before anything is snapshotted.

**Define a target.** The secret is never a command-line flag — it would land in
your shell history:

```bash
export SDS_BACKUP_SECRET='...'
sds backup target add --name offsite --kind s3 \
    --bucket sds-backups --endpoint https://s3.example.com --user AKIAEXAMPLE

sds backup target add --name nas --kind smb \
    --host nas.example.com --share backups --user backupuser --secret-file -

sds backup target list        # secrets are never returned
```

An SMB host may carry a non-standard port (`--host nas.example.com:4450`).

**Take and restore a backup:**

```bash
sds backup create --resource db --target offsite
sds backup list
sds backup restore <backup-id> --node node1
sds backup delete <backup-id>
```

**Incremental after the first.** The first backup of a resource to a target is
a full image. On thin pools every later one carries only the blocks that changed
since the previous one: the thin pool's own metadata says which (`thin_delta`),
so nothing is read or hashed to find out. In a test on three VMs, a 1 GiB
volume took 20 s and 161 MB as a full backup, and 4.5 s and 26 MB for the next
one after 26 MB of changes.

```bash
sds backup create --resource db --target offsite          # incremental when it can be
sds backup create --resource db --target offsite --full   # start a new chain
```

A backup falls back to full, and says why in the controller log, when there is
no earlier completed backup on that target, the backup is read on a different
node than the last one, a volume was added, resized or moved to another backing
volume since, the base snapshot is gone, the volume is thick, or 30
incrementals already follow the last full one.

What an incremental costs:

- **A base snapshot stays on the node.** The snapshot of the last backup is kept
  (named `<volume>_bk_<time>`) and holds whatever the volume has overwritten
  since — the space a scheduled snapshot of that age would hold. It moves
  forward with each backup and goes when its backup is deleted.
- **A chain restores as a whole.** Restoring an incremental writes its full
  backup and then every incremental after it, oldest first. None of them can be
  deleted while a later one exists; delete newest first.

**Which replica is read.** Without `--node`: the node holding the last backup's
base snapshot, while it is UpToDate; otherwise an UpToDate Secondary, so the
snapshot's cost lands away from the workload, and the Primary only when no
Secondary is UpToDate. The DR replica of a WAN resource is never picked, since
it may be behind. A thick volume's snapshot reserves 20% of the volume (at
least 256 MiB) of free space in its volume group up front, so a replica whose
group lacks that room is passed over for one that has it.

**Scheduled backups.** One schedule per resource and target, run by the active
controller (it carries on after a controller failover). Each backup records the
schedule that took it (`schedule=` in `backup list`, and in its manifest, so it
survives an import). Retention counts only the schedule's own backups, the way
snapshot schedules count snapshots, and never deletes a backup taken by hand,
with one addition: a kept incremental keeps every backup down to its full one,
whoever took it. A daily schedule
keeping 7 can therefore hold up to a month of backups until the chain restarts
with a full one. A schedule must keep at least one tier; `--disabled` saves it
without running it.

```bash
sds backup schedule create --resource db --target offsite \
    --cron "30 18 * * *" --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 3
sds backup schedule list          # last run, the backup it made or why it failed, next run
sds backup schedule run db@offsite   # run now, retention included, and wait
sds backup schedule delete db@offsite   # its backups stay
```

The cron is in the controller's time zone — usually UTC on a server. A run
still going when the next one is due skips that tick. A failed run raises a
`backup.failed` event, delivered like any alert (it needs `[alert] enabled`),
and resolves with the next completed run. Failed records older than the newest
completed backup are removed by the schedule. Backup schedules run on the
snapshot scheduler, so `[schedule] enabled = false` in `controller.toml` stops
them too.

**When the controller's database is gone, or the backups belong to another
cluster.** Each backup leaves a `manifest.json` next to its images on the
target. `backup import` reads them and rebuilds the records, incremental chains
included:

```bash
sds node register ...                       # a rebuilt cluster: nodes first
sds backup target add --name offsite ...    # same bucket and --prefix as before
sds backup import --target offsite
sds resource create --name db --size 20G ...   # at least as large as the backup
sds backup restore <backup-id> --resource db
```

Importing twice records nothing twice. A backup whose images are not all on the
target is skipped and named. The next backup after an import is full unless the
newest backup's base snapshot is still on that node of this cluster. The
images are raw block data, so a backup restores onto another architecture or
pool type: a chain taken from an arm64 node's thin pool restores onto a thick
LVM volume on x86.

**Immutable backups: S3 Object Lock.** Whoever holds the cluster — a stolen sds
token, root on a storage node — can delete ordinary backups, and ransomware
does that first. A locked target stores every object under S3 Object Lock, so
until its date neither sds nor anyone using sds's keys can delete or overwrite
it:

```bash
sds backup target add --name vault --kind s3 --bucket sds-vault \
    --endpoint https://s3.example.com --user AKIAEXAMPLE \
    --lock-mode compliance --lock-days 30
```

- **The bucket** must be created with Object Lock enabled (which turns on
  versioning; it cannot be added later on most servers). AWS S3, MinIO, Ceph
  RGW, Backblaze B2 and Wasabi support it. Every backup reads each object's lock
  back and is **failed** when the server stored it unlocked — some
  S3-compatible servers accept the headers and ignore them.
- **rclone 1.74.0 or later** on the nodes; older ones upload unlocked, so the
  backup is refused before anything is snapshotted.
- **Modes.** `governance` can be lifted by a principal holding
  `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention`; `compliance` by no one, the bucket owner
  included, until it expires.
- **Chains.** A lock cannot be extended once written, and an incremental needs
  every backup down to its full one. So every backup of a chain is locked until
  chain start + `--full-every-days` (default 7) + `--lock-days`, and a backup
  more than `--full-every-days` after its chain started is full. Each backup is
  locked for at least `--lock-days`; budget storage for up to
  `--full-every-days` + `--lock-days` of backups.
- **Deleting and retention.** `backup delete` refuses a locked backup;
  `--force` drops only the record and leaves the objects. A schedule's
  retention leaves locked backups for a later run. Once the lock has expired, a
  delete leaves a delete marker over the object; add a lifecycle rule that
  expires noncurrent versions (say 7 days after they become noncurrent) to get
  the space back.
- **Restores read what was written.** A locked backup is read as of an hour
  after it finished (`--s3-version-at`), so a version written over it, or a
  delete marker on top, changes nothing a restore sees.
- **After the backups were deleted anyway.** On a versioned bucket a delete
  only hides an object. `backup import --as-of <RFC3339>` reads the target as
  it was at that time, records what it finds, and restores read those
  versions:

  ```bash
  sds backup import --target vault --as-of 2026-10-01T00:00:00Z
  ```

**The keys decide whether any of this holds.** sds's S3 credentials are on the
storage nodes, so assume an attacker has them. They need only:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectRetention", "s3:GetObject",
               "s3:GetObjectVersion", "s3:GetObjectRetention", "s3:DeleteObject",
               "s3:ListBucket", "s3:ListBucketVersions"],
    "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::sds-vault", "arn:aws:s3:::sds-vault/*"]
  }]
}
```

and must **not** hold `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention`, `s3:DeleteObjectVersion`,
`s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration`, `s3:PutBucketVersioning` or
`s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration` — any one of them makes the lock a formality.
`s3:DeleteObject` only adds delete markers on a versioned bucket. What each
layer stops:

| Attacker holds | Object Lock (compliance) | Object Lock (governance) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| an sds token or admin account | stopped | stopped |
| root on a storage node (and so sds's S3 keys) | stopped | stopped, if the keys lack the bypass permission |
| root on the controller | stopped | same as above |
| the object store account itself | stopped | not stopped |

Know the limits before you build a policy on this:
- Only a backup listed as `completed` is restorable. `running` means it is still
  uploading; `failed` means it is not a usable copy, and its objects were
  removed. Completion is verified against the target's own reported size, not
  just the exit code. A controller that restarts marks any `running` backup
  `failed`.
- **LVM-backed volumes only.** A resource on a ZFS pool is refused.
- **Restore overwrites from byte zero.** It refuses when the resource is Primary
  anywhere, when a gateway exports it, or when the destination is smaller than
  the image. It promotes the resource on the node it writes through for the
  duration and demotes it afterwards.
- A target that backups still reference cannot be deleted without `--force`;
  `backup delete --force` drops a record whose objects can no longer be
  removed.

## 10. Gateways — exporting to clients

A gateway turns a resource into something a non-SDS machine can mount: NFS,
iSCSI or NVMe-oF. It is a drbd-reactor promoter config, so it fails over with
the resource — clients keep talking to a floating service IP.

```bash
# NFS
sds gateway nfs create --resource data --service-ip 192.0.2.200/24 \
    --export-path /data --allowed-ips 192.0.2.0/24

# iSCSI
sds gateway iscsi create --resource blk \
    --iqn iqn.2026-01.com.example:sds.blk --service-ip 192.0.2.201/24

# NVMe-oF
sds gateway nvme create --resource fast \
    --nqn nqn.2026-01.com.example:sds.fast --service-ip 192.0.2.202/24
```

Creation checks that the OCF agents and tools the chain needs are installed on
the resource's diskful nodes (see below), formats the state volume (and, for NFS, the exported volume)
when it carries no filesystem, writes the promoter config
(`/etc/drbd-reactor.d/sds-<type>-<resource>.toml`) to the resource's diskful
nodes only, and reloads drbd-reactor there. A gateway needs a small
cluster-private state volume (volume 0) beside the exported data; a
single-volume resource gets one added automatically (`[gateway]
auto_state_volume`, default on, `state_volume_size_gb` default 1).

Managing a live gateway:

```bash
sds gateway list                       # or: gateway nfs|iscsi|nvme list; read from the nodes
sds gateway get --resource data
sds gateway status --resource data
sds gateway stop  --resource data      # demote and stop, config kept
sds gateway start --resource data
sds gateway delete --resource data
```

Per-protocol details:

```bash
sds gateway nfs export add|list|remove ...      # extra exports on an NFS gateway
sds gateway nfs export quota --resource data --path team-a --size 500G
                                                    # cap an export directory (0 removes)
sds gateway nfs mount --resource data --target /mnt/data --mkdir --sudo
                                                    # mount it on this machine
sds gateway iscsi lun add|list|remove ...       # LUNs
sds gateway iscsi chap get|set ...              # one-way CHAP only; mutual CHAP is not supported
sds gateway iscsi initiator add|list|remove ... # initiator allow-list
sds gateway nvme namespace add|list|remove ...  # namespaces
sds gateway nvme host add|list|remove ...       # host allow-list
```

An export directory's quota is an ext4 project quota on the gateway's
filesystem, so one export cannot fill the volume for the others. Gateways
created from this version on support it (the filesystem is made with the
project feature and mounted with `prjquota`); an older one needs the feature
added while unmounted — `tune2fs -O quota,project <device>` — and the gateway
recreated. The gateway nodes need the `quota` package (`setquota`).

Gateways cannot limit a client's IOPS or bandwidth: their I/O is done by kernel
threads in the root cgroup, which has no I/O limits, and neither LIO nor nvmet
limits per LUN. Shape traffic to the service IP with `tc` on the gateway nodes
if you must. DRBD's `c-max-rate` limits resync traffic only; it is not QoS.

These edits read the gateway's promoter config from the resource's diskful
nodes — not from the machine the controller runs on — and write the result
back to all of them. If the nodes hold different copies, the one most of them
hold is used (a tie goes to the first node by name), a warning names the
nodes that differ, and the write makes them identical again.

**When an edit takes effect.**

- *Stopped gateway*: the edit goes into the `.toml.disabled` copy and takes
  effect at the next `gateway start`. Nothing on the nodes is touched and the
  gateway stays stopped.
- *Running gateway*: the edit takes effect **immediately on the node that runs
  it**, without restarting the gateway, and the other diskful nodes are ready
  to run the edited gateway on failover. Per edit:

  | Edit | Applied on the running node by | Clients |
  | ---- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
  | `iscsi initiator add` | `targetcli … acls create <iqn> add_mapped_luns=true` (all LUNs mapped) | new initiator can log in at once |
  | `iscsi initiator remove` | `targetcli … acls delete <iqn>` | that initiator's sessions are closed; others unaffected |
  | `iscsi chap set` | `targetcli … set auth` on every ACL (or the TPG when all initiators are allowed) | applies at the next login; existing sessions stay |
  | `iscsi lun add` / `remove` | starts / stops just that LUN's `ocf.rs@lu<N>_<res>` unit | other LUNs unaffected |
  | `nvme host add` / `remove` | links / unlinks the host in the subsystem's `allowed_hosts` (configfs) | a removed host keeps an existing connection until it reconnects |
  | `nvme namespace add` / `remove` | starts / stops just that namespace's unit | other namespaces unaffected |
  | `nfs export add` / `remove` | starts / stops just that export's `exportfs` unit | other exports unaffected |

  Removing the last initiator or host makes the target accept every initiator
  again (an empty allow-list means "allow all"), live as well. Changes that
  cannot be applied without restarting the gateway (e.g. removing CHAP) are
  refused before anything is written; stop the gateway, edit, start it.
- *Running nowhere* (enabled, but no node has it up): the config is written and
  drbd-reactor reloaded, which starts it with the edit.

drbd-reactor itself cannot apply a changed promoter config to a running
gateway: on `systemctl reload drbd-reactor` it stops the old promoter and
starts a new one, and SDS promoters are written with
`stop-services-on-exit = true`, so a reload with a changed config stops the
whole gateway on that node and lets every node race to promote it again.
SDS therefore never reloads drbd-reactor on the node running the gateway for
an edit: that node keeps the `.toml` its drbd-reactor loaded and gets the
edited one as `sds-<type>-<res>.toml.pending`, which drbd-reactor ignores.
The unit drop-ins in `/run/systemd/system` are rewritten to the edited chain,
so a unit restart or a later failback uses it, and a drop-in on
`drbd-reactor.service` (`50-sds-pending-gateway-config.conf`) moves the
`.pending` file into place before drbd-reactor next starts; the next edit made
while another node runs the gateway replaces it too. **Do not run
`systemctl reload drbd-reactor` on the running node by hand to "pick up" a
gateway edit** — it restarts the gateway. If the live step fails, the command
says so: the config is saved everywhere and a failover uses it, and
`sds gateway stop` then `sds gateway start` applies it now (interrupting
clients).

Target and initiator IQNs (at `iscsi create` and `initiator add`) and host
NQNs are checked before anything is written, with the rules LIO and nvmet
apply: an iSCSI name must be `iqn.<yyyy-mm>.<domain with at
least two labels>[:<name>]` without spaces or `_` (`iqn.2026-10.test:probe` is
refused, `iqn.2026-10.lab.test:probe` is accepted), `eui.` + 16 hex digits, or
`naa.` + 16 hex digits starting with 1, 2 or 5; a host NQN must be
`nqn.<yyyy-mm>.<reversed domain>[:<name>]` or
`nqn.2014-08.org.nvmexpress:uuid:<uuid>`. A name LIO rejects would otherwise be
accepted here and fail the target's next start, leaving the gateway down.

`iscsi create` also takes `--allowed-initiators`, `--username`/`--password` for
CHAP, and `--implementation lio` (the default and the only one supported; `tgt`
and `iet` are refused). `nvme create` takes `--transport tcp` (default) or
`rdma`; `nvmet` and the transport's module (`nvmet-tcp` or `nvmet-rdma`) are
loaded on the nodes at creation and added to
`/etc/modules-load.d/nvmet.conf`. `rdma` also requires an RDMA device under
`/sys/class/infiniband`.

**What clients need.** Windows has a built-in iSCSI initiator and a limited
NFSv3 client; macOS has a built-in NFS client and no iSCSI initiator. There is
no SMB gateway. Pick the protocol by what the client can actually mount.

**What creation checks.** Every gateway needs the OCF agents from
`resource-agents-extra` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `resource-agents` (EL). On top:

| Gateway | Checked | Install |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| NFS | `rpc.nfsd`, `exportfs` | `nfs-kernel-server` (Debian/Ubuntu), `nfs-utils` (EL) |
| iSCSI | `targetcli` | `targetcli-fb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `targetcli` (EL) |
| NVMe-oF | kernel modules, loaded at creation | `linux-modules-extra` on Ubuntu cloud kernels |

Anything missing fails creation with the list of what is missing and what to
install; no config is written.

## 11. High availability

`ha create` declares what should run wherever the resource is Primary.
drbd-reactor then picks a node, mounts the filesystem, starts the services,
raises the VIP — and moves all of it if that node dies. The VIP comes last, so
clients only reach a node whose services are up, and it is the first thing
taken down; `ha create` sets `net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind` on the nodes so a
service that binds to the VIP itself can start before it. (Configs created
before this ordered the VIP ahead of the services; they keep that order until
recreated.)

```bash
sds ha create db \
    --vip 192.0.2.210/24 \
    --mount /var/lib/postgresql \
    --fstype ext4 \
    --services postgresql.service

sds ha list
sds ha status db
sds ha delete db
```

`ha create` makes a filesystem of `--fstype` on the device when it finds none,
and refuses when a `--services` unit is missing on any of the resource's nodes.

`ha create` and the gateways put a drbd-reactor promoter on the resource, so
they refuse a resource whose Primary something else decides, which the promoter
would fight for the role: a Proxmox VM disk (labelled `sds.pve/managed-by=pve`
by the plugin, or named `pve-<vmid>-...` from before it labelled them), a CSI
volume (`sds.csi/managed-by=csi`), and a resource with diskless clients.

Move it deliberately — for maintenance, or to test that failover works:

```bash
sds ha evict db
```

**Test your failover before you need it.** Evicting is the polite path; pulling
power on the active node is the honest one.

### The controller's own HA

The controller is a single process. Self-HA puts it on the same machinery as
everything else: its database lives on a replicated resource, and a VIP follows
whichever node is running it.

```bash
sds ha self enable --vip 192.0.2.250/24 --pool thin-pool
sds ha self status
sds ha self disable --node node1     # back to a plain service on node1
```

`enable` creates the `sds-meta` resource (1 GB on DRBD port 7999 by default;
`--size`, `--port`, `--nodes` change that), copies the running controller
binary, its config and its systemd unit to the other nodes, and hands the
controller to drbd-reactor. The binary goes to the path the unit's `ExecStart`
names. A node of another architecture gets `sds-controller-<goarch>` from beside
the running binary instead; without one, `enable` refuses that node before
changing anything. The controller restarts during the handoff, so the
command's connection drops; follow it with `ha self status` against the VIP.
`disable` copies the database back to the named node and leaves `sds-meta` in
place for you to delete. `sds ha evict sds-meta` moves the controller to
another node.

Point clients at the VIP afterwards. Other services can be made to ride along —
`[self_ha] extra_services = ["sds-ai.service"]` in `controller.toml` starts and
stops the AI Copilot with the controller.

---

## 12. Cross-site replication (WAN DR)

WAN replication keeps an asynchronous replica at another site, over the public
internet, through a TCP proxy with mTLS. It is opt-in per resource because it
uses protocol A (asynchronous): the primary does not wait for the DR site.

A resync across the WAN compares SHA-256 checksums before sending a block
(`csums-alg sha256`), so blocks both sites already hold cross the link as a
checksum, not as data. Resync speed follows DRBD's dynamic controller; to cap
it for a group of resources, set it on their profile:
`sds resource profile set-options <profile> --drbd-options disk/c-max-rate=20M`.
WAN resources created before this default can get it with
`sds resource set-options <name> --drbd-options net/csums-alg=sha256`.

```bash
sds resource create --name db --size 100G --port 7000 \
    --nodes node1,node2 \
    --wan --dr-node dr1 --dr-endpoint dr.example.com
```

`--dr-endpoint` is an address or host name, without a port: the WAN port is
`--wan-port`, and 0 (the default) picks a random port above 3000.
`--wan-egress-address` pins the outbound side to one interface when the primary
has several.

A resource that is already running gets its DR replica in place, while it keeps
serving:

```bash
sds resource add-dr db --dr-node dr1 --dr-endpoint dr.example.com
```

The DR node joins over one `sds-proxy` leg per primary-site replica, with
protocol A and pull-ahead, and does not vote: quorum stays with the primary
site.

When the DR site's address changes, or the primary should dial out from
another interface:

```bash
sds wan set-endpoint db --dr-endpoint dr2.example.com
sds wan set-endpoint db --egress-address 203.0.113.20     # or --clear-egress
```

The tunnels are rebuilt on the new address at once. A new endpoint that does
not answer is refused and the old one kept — the old tunnel was working. For a
DR site whose firewall is not open yet, `--skip-check` saves it anyway; run
`wan repair` once it answers. Renumbering the DR node with `node set-address`
moves an endpoint that was that node's address by itself.

DR is manual on purpose — an automatic cross-site promotion during a network
partition is how you get two live copies:

```bash
sds resource dr-failover db          # prints what it will do
sds resource dr-failover db --yes    # force-promotes the DR node
```

Writes still buffered in the WAN link when the primary site died are lost.
Mount the volumes on the DR node and resume there.

Coming back is `dr-failback`, run repeatedly until it says done:

```bash
sds resource dr-failback db --wait 30m
```

It reconnects the primary-site nodes, **discarding what they wrote after the
failover** in favour of the DR copy, waits for them to resync from the DR, then
makes a primary-site node (`--node`, default the first) Primary again. Each
primary-site node must be unmounted for the first step and the DR node for the
last.

Each primary-site node gets its own tunnel ("leg"). If a node is renumbered or
removed, its leg can be left behind:

```bash
sds wan repair db --dry-run     # show the plan, touch nothing
sds wan repair db
```

It converges, so running it on a healthy resource reports nothing to do. It
restarts tunnels, so use `--dry-run` first.

---

## 13. Storage tiering

Put an SSD in front of a thin pool, and every volume in the pool reads and
writes through it (lvmcache).

```bash
sds pool add-cache --node node1 --pool thin-pool --device /dev/nvme0n1
sds pool remove-cache --node node1 --pool thin-pool
```

The device is consumed whole and must be free — no filesystem signature, no
partitions in use, not already a PV — and at least 4 GiB. A pool takes one
cache. `sds pool get` shows the cache and how much of a writeback cache is
dirty.

**Writethrough is the default. `--mode writeback` must be asked for by name**,
because it puts the SSD in the durability path: a node that dies with a dirty
cache takes acknowledged writes with it, and the surviving replica may never
have seen them. `remove-cache` flushes first and reports failure if the flush
cannot be confirmed, rather than letting you pull a device with data on it.

The cache is per node. DRBD replicates volumes, not the block layer beneath
them, so caching one replica and not another is a legitimate end state.

Requires a thin pool: a thick pool has no single LV that every volume passes
through.

---

## 14. Encryption

`--encrypt` wraps each replica's backing volume in its own LUKS2 container, so
the stack is DRBD → LUKS → LVM.

```bash
sds resource create --name secrets --size 50G --port 7010 \
    --nodes node1,node2 --encrypt
```

Understand exactly what this does and does not do:

- **At rest only.** DRBD sits above the crypt layer, so replication traffic
  between nodes is plaintext. Encrypt it with replication TLS, below.
- **Each node generates and keeps its own key** under `/etc/sds/luks`, root-only.
  Nothing is sent anywhere and there is no central escrow. Lose a node's key and
  that replica is gone — the others are unaffected.
- **It cannot be enabled later.** Decide at creation.
- LVM pools only.
- **Backups are plaintext.** `sds backup` reads each snapshot through a
  temporary read-only LUKS mapping on the node it backs up from, so the image
  holds the volume's data and restores onto any replica. The key stays on the
  node, which means the target receives plaintext: protect it with the target's
  own encryption and access policy. Backups taken by versions before this held
  the ciphertext, cannot be restored, and are refused by `backup restore`;
  the first backup after upgrading is a full one.

**Encrypted replication.** DRBD 9.2 and later can run a connection over kernel
TLS: the kernel asks `tlshd` (package `ktls-utils`) to do the handshake, then
encrypts in place. Install `ktls-utils` on every node, then:

```bash
sds replication-tls setup            # every node: key, certificate, tlshd
sds replication-tls status           # READY per node, or what is missing
sds resource tls db on               # encrypt every connection of db
sds resource status db               # each peer shows "tls"
sds resource tls db off
```

`setup` has each node make its own key, signs a certificate for it with the
controller's replication CA (kept next to the database), installs that CA in
the node's system trust store, points `tlshd` at the certificate and loads the
`tls` module at boot. A peer whose certificate this CA did not sign is refused
at the handshake. Run `setup` again to renew certificates; `status` warns 30
days before one expires.

- **Live switch.** DRBD cannot change a connection's transport while it is up,
  so `resource tls` takes one link down at a time and brings it back while the
  others keep quorum. The Primary keeps serving; the reconnected peer catches up
  with a short resync. In a test on three VMs, switching a resource's three
  links took about 15 s under a continuous write load, with no failed write.
- **A failed handshake is not retried.** DRBD leaves that link StandAlone and
  the switch stops, naming it. Fix the node (`journalctl -u tlshd`), then
  `sds resource repair <resource>`.
- **New members must be ready.** Adding a replica, a diskless client or a
  tiebreaker to an encrypted resource is refused on a node that is not.
- **The CA joins the system trust store**, because `tlshd` before ktls-utils
  0.10 has no setting for a private one. Anything on a node that validates
  against that store will accept a certificate it issued; it only ever issues
  replication certificates.
- **Not for WAN resources.** Their off-site leg already runs mutual TLS through
  `sds-proxy`.

---

## 15. Alerts and notifications

Turn detection on in `controller.toml`:

```toml
[alert]
enabled = true                # default false
check_interval_sec = 30       # default
check_nodes = true            # default; SSH-probe each node, produces node.unreachable
check_pools = true            # default; thin pool data/metadata use
pool_near_full_percent = 85   # default; warning
pool_full_percent = 95        # default; critical
history_size = 500            # default; kept in the database across failovers
watch_drbd_events = true      # default; see below
idle_interval_sec = 300       # default
warning_hold_sec = 30         # default; see below
```

A **warning** is raised only once its condition has lasted `warning_hold_sec`:
a replica link that drops and reconnects within it is not reported. Critical
conditions — a full pool, a lost Primary, an unreachable node — are never held.

With `watch_drbd_events` the controller keeps one `drbdsetup events2` stream
open to each node. A DRBD state change is checked within a few seconds instead
of at the next poll, and while every node's stream is up and nothing is
resyncing or verifying, the cluster is polled every `idle_interval_sec` rather
than every `check_interval_sec`. That interval still bounds what DRBD does not
report, such as a thin pool filling up.

Events: `resource.degraded`, `resource.failover`, `resource.no_primary`,
`resource.promoted`, `node.unreachable`, `wan.degraded`, `resource.out_of_sync`,
`pool.data_near_full`, `pool.data_full`, `pool.metadata_near_full`,
`pool.metadata_full`, `pool.out_of_space` (LVM already refused writes),
`pool.vdo_physical_near_full`, `pool.vdo_physical_full` (the physical space
under an `lvm-thin-vdo` pool),
`pool.snapshots_removed` (a near-full pool gave up a scheduled snapshot),
`pool.snapshots_locked` (a near-full pool with only locked snapshots left),
`audit.shipping_failed`, `audit.truncated`, `approval.requested` (see [Access control](#16-access-control)),
`controller.clock_jumped`, `resource.write_anomaly`, `node.evicted`,
`resource.replica_moved`,
`backup.failed` (a scheduled backup) and `inspection.completed` (see
[Inspection](#inspection)). Each carries a severity
(`info`/`warning`/`critical`) and a status — `firing` when a condition starts,
`resolved` when it clears, `info` for a one-off such as an inspection — so a
receiver can pair an alert with its recovery instead of reading the recovery as
a new fault.

```bash
sds event list --resource db --min-severity warning
sds event watch --min-severity critical
sds event watch --type resource.failover --json
sds event watch --replay          # retained history first, then live
```

`event list` and `event watch` take `--resource`, `--type`, `--min-severity`
and `--since-id` (resume after a disconnect).

### Sending them somewhere

A chat service will not accept an arbitrary JSON document, so a channel has a
**kind**. Worse, Feishu, WeCom and DingTalk report a refusal *inside an HTTP
200*, so a misconfigured channel looks like it is working until an outage passes
unnoticed.

```bash
sds channel add --name oncall --kind feishu \
    --url https://open.feishu.cn/open-apis/bot/v2/hook/xxxx --min-severity warning

sds channel add --name pager --kind slack \
    --url https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00/B00/xxxx --min-severity critical

export SDS_NOTIFY_SECRET=SECxxxx        # DingTalk 加签, never a flag
sds channel add --name ops --kind dingtalk \
    --url 'https://oapi.dingtalk.com/robot/send?access_token=xxxx'

sds channel test oncall             # reports what the service itself said
sds channel list
sds channel delete ops
```

`--type` limits a channel to some event types
(`--type resource.failover,node.unreachable`); `--header Name=Value` adds a
request header, for a receiver that wants a token. Re-running `add` without a
secret keeps the stored DingTalk secret; `--clear-secret` removes it.

Kinds: `generic` (the event JSON unchanged, for a receiver you wrote), `feishu`,
`slack`, `wecom`, `dingtalk`. A well-known bot URL saved with the wrong kind is
refused up front rather than at delivery time.

**Always run `channel test` after adding one.** It is the only thing that
distinguishes a working channel from a silent one.

Channels live in the controller database, so adding or muting one takes effect
immediately — no restart. `--muted` stores a channel without delivering to it,
which is how you silence a noisy pager during an incident without having to find
the bot URL again afterwards.

Receivers can also be set in `controller.toml`: `webhook_url` (with
`webhook_min_severity`) or `[[alert.webhooks]]` entries with `url`,
`min_severity` and `headers` under `[alert]`. They post the generic event JSON,
need a restart to change, and work alongside channels.

The same events are also readable on the REST API (`[server] rest_port`, default 3375) at
`GET /v1/events`, streamable as newline-delimited JSON at `/v1/events/watch`,
and pushed to the web UI's bell over `/v1/events/stream`.

### Metrics

The controller serves Prometheus metrics at `http://<controller>:9433/metrics`
(`[metrics]`: `enabled` default true, `listen_address` default `0.0.0.0`,
`port` default 9433). The cluster gauges below are fed by the health poll, so
they stay empty unless `[alert] enabled = true`; the controller logs a warning
at startup when it is not. Besides the API's own request counts and latencies
(`sds_controller_grpc_requests_total`, `sds_controller_grpc_request_duration_seconds`)
and the counts `sds_controller_resources{state}`, `sds_controller_nodes{state}`
and `sds_controller_gateways{type,state}`:

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sds_drbd_role`, `sds_drbd_disk_state`, `sds_drbd_replication_state` | resource, node, role/state | 1 for the state each replica holds now |
| `sds_drbd_quorum` | resource, node | 0 when the node that answered has lost quorum |
| `sds_drbd_resource_up` | resource | 0 when no node answered for the resource |
| `sds_drbd_resync_completed_ratio` | resource, node | 1 when in sync |
| `sds_drbd_out_of_sync_bytes` | resource, node | data DRBD has marked as differing |
| `sds_drbd_connection_tls` | resource, node | 1 when that connection is encrypted |
| `sds_controller_node_reachable` | node | 0 when the controller cannot reach it |
| `sds_controller_pool_thin_used_percent` | pool, node, kind | thin pool data/metadata use |
| `sds_controller_storage_capacity_bytes` | pool, node, state | total/used/free |
| `sds_controller_alerts_firing` | type, severity | conditions raised now |
| `sds_controller_backup_last_success_timestamp_seconds` | resource, target | newest completed backup |
| `sds_controller_backup_last_shipped_bytes` | resource, target, kind | what it carried |
| `sds_controller_resource_fault_domain_risk` | resource, domain | 1 when one domain's loss takes it down |
| `sds_controller_last_observation_timestamp_seconds` | source | when each source last answered |

A series nobody observed is absent rather than zero: a replica that stopped
answering has no `sds_drbd_disk_state`, and `sds_drbd_resource_up` says why.
`deploy/monitoring/prometheus-rules.yml` has alerting rules on these
(controller down, stale observations, unreachable node, lost quorum, unreadable
resource, replica not UpToDate, out of sync, thin pool near full and full,
backup older than two days, one-failure-domain risk), and `deploy/monitoring`
a Docker Compose stack (Prometheus plus a Grafana with an "SDS" dashboard) that
uses them.

### Inspection

Alerts fire when a condition starts. An inspection asks what they do not: did
the alert reach anyone, is a replica that says Connected actually replicating,
is the node still at the address it is registered at. It runs a fixed set of
checks, changes nothing, and stores a report in which every finding has a
status (`pass`, `warn`, `fail`, or `error` when the check itself could not
run), the evidence, and the command that fixes it.

```bash
sds inspect run                         # now; waits for the report
sds inspect run --area alerts,nodes     # only some areas
sds inspect list
sds inspect show                        # newest; or: sds inspect show 42
sds inspect show latest --json
```

Each node is probed once over SSH per run; a node that does not answer is a
`nodes.ssh` failure and `error` for its other checks, not a failed run.

| Area | Checks |
| ---- | ------ |
| resources | a resource under `sds ha create` has exactly one Primary; on every node: replica Outdated, Inconsistent with no resync, Diskless where it should hold data, not up, quorum lost; a peer StandAlone; a peer no node can reach, reported once per peer — fail for a diskful peer, warn for a tiebreaker or diskless client (the data is still fully redundant); a Connected peer stuck in WFBitMapS/WFBitMapT/WFSyncUUID (or Off between two diskful nodes) — judged from every node's own view, because a handshake can be stuck on one side only; two-node quorum risk (warn); single-failure-domain risk (one warn per domain, listing its resources); an HA promoter config missing on a primary-site diskful node (warn), present on a diskless one (warn: it works as a diskless Primary, over the network) or present on a WAN resource's DR node (warn: it could fail over to the asynchronous copy unasked) |
| gateways | every gateway not `stopped` has exactly one Primary; its promoter config on every diskful node (warn when missing, and when present on a diskless node) |
| nodes | SSH reachable; clock skew against the controller (warn > 2 s, fail > 30 s; SSH latency is not counted), NTP synchronised; root filesystem (warn ≥ 85 %, fail ≥ 95 %); the registered address present on an interface (a public address answering as the registered host is taken as NAT, not drift), and the address answering as the registered host; drbd module loaded; drbd-reactor running; DRBD module, drbd-utils, drbd-reactor and `sds-controller` binary the same on every node, the binary compared only between nodes of one architecture (a differing binary fails under Self-HA); `/etc/hosts` mapping a node name to an address it is not registered at |
| pools | thin pool data and metadata against `[alert] pool_near_full_percent` / `pool_full_percent`; growth since the previous report, warn when full within 14 days, fail within 3; on a thick pool, free space below the copy-on-write area a snapshot of a volume reserves (20 % of it, at least 256 MiB), naming the volumes whose snapshots and backups will fail (warn) |
| backups | each enabled backup schedule: last run failed, target missing, last success older than 1.5 cron intervals (warn) or 3 (fail); snapshot schedules not run for 1.5 / 3 intervals; schedules enabled while `[schedule] enabled = false`; `_bk_` snapshots no backup record refers to |
| alerts | `[alert]` enabled; at least one enabled channel; each channel's last deliveries succeeded; every warning or critical raised in the last 24 h was accepted by a channel that delivered it. No test message is sent |
| selfha | at least two UpToDate copies of `sds-meta`; its promoter config active on every diskful candidate (and noted on a diskless one); exactly one `sds-controller` active, on the `sds-meta` Primary; a controller binary on every candidate |
| tls | API server certificate, replication CA and every node's replication certificate: warn under 30 days, fail under 7 or expired |
| hygiene | `/etc/drbd.d/*.res` and SDS-named volumes (`<res>_data`, `<res>_volN`, `<res>_state*`, `_sched_` snapshots) of resources the controller no longer has. Listed, never deleted |

```toml
[inspect]
enabled = true            # default
schedule = "0 1 * * *"    # default; cron, controller time zone
keep = 30                 # default; reports stored
notify_min = "warn"       # default; pass | warn | fail
```

The schedule rides the snapshot scheduler, so it runs on the active controller
only and only while `[schedule] enabled = true`; `sds inspect run` works either
way. Each run publishes one `inspection.completed` event when its worst finding
is at least `notify_min`: severity `critical` for a fail, `warning` for a warn
or error, `info` otherwise, with the counts and the first failing items in the
message. It goes to notification channels like any alert, so it needs
`[alert] enabled = true`; a channel filtered to `warning` hears from the
inspection only when it found something. `sds-mcp` exposes the same as
`sds_inspect_run` and `sds_inspect_report`.

Channel delivery results (last success, last failure and its error, events
given up on) are recorded per channel as alerts are delivered; that record is
what the `alerts` area reads.

---

## 16. Access control

With nothing configured, the API accepts every caller. Two models, in
`controller.toml`:

```toml
[auth]                  # one shared token for every caller
enabled = true
token = "..."

[rbac]                  # per-user tokens with roles; replaces [auth]
enabled = true
[[rbac.users]]
name = "admin"
token = "..."
role = "admin"
```

Roles are `admin`, `operator`, `viewer` and `security-officer`. Every API call is classified by
object (pool, resource, gateway, snapshot, backup, node, ha, approval, system) and action
(read, write, approve). An operator may write pools, resources, gateways, snapshots,
backups and HA, and only read nodes and system settings; a viewer can only
read; an admin can do everything. `[[rbac.policies]]` entries (`role`,
`object`, `action`, either may be `*`) add grants or define further roles.

```bash
sds rbac whoami                          # your identity and role
sds rbac policies                        # effective roles and assignments (admin only)
sds rbac user add --name alice --role operator   # prints a generated token once
sds rbac user add --name ci --role viewer --user-token <16+ chars>   # set the token yourself
sds rbac user set-role alice viewer
sds rbac user remove alice
```

Users added this way are kept in the controller database. Users declared in
`controller.toml` are re-applied at every start and cannot be removed through
the API, so an admin always remains. The `rbac` commands use the gRPC API
like every other command, so `--token` and the TLS options below apply to them.

Tokens come from `--token`, `SDS_TOKEN`, `~/.sds/token` or `/etc/sds/token`.

**Two-person approval.** A role says what a user may do, and an admin may do
everything — so one stolen admin token could delete the backup target, the
backups and the snapshots. With approval on, the calls that destroy data or
weaken what protects it run only after a *different* user approved that exact
call:

```toml
[rbac.approval]
enabled = true
ttl_minutes = 60     # how long a request waits, and how long an approved call may then be made
# methods = [...]    # default: the list below
```

```bash
$ sds backup target remove offsite                 # alice
Error: DeleteBackupTarget needs a second person's approval: request 3f9a1c2b7d10 is pending ...
$ sds approval list                                # bob
$ sds approval approve 3f9a1c2b7d10                # bob; alice cannot approve her own
$ sds backup target remove offsite                 # alice again: runs, once
```

The approval covers the method and its exact arguments, so approving the
removal of one target cannot be spent removing another. Who may approve: an
admin, or a `security-officer`, who can read everything and approve, and change
nothing. Each new request raises an `approval.requested` event, so approvers
hear of it — and an unexpected one is a stolen token at work.

The default list: deleting pools, ZFS pools and datasets, resources, volumes
and snapshots; restoring snapshots and backups (both overwrite the volume);
adding, replacing or removing a backup target; deleting backups and snapshot
or backup schedules; and adding users, removing them or changing roles — so
the stolen token cannot create its own second approver. The web UI's user
management is held back the same way. Approval needs `[rbac]`; the controller
refuses to start with one and not the other.

Automation is held back too: the CSI driver deleting a PVC and the Proxmox
plugin removing or rolling back a VM disk call `DeleteResource` and
`RestoreSnapshot`, which then wait for an approver like anyone else. Where that
is not wanted, list `methods` yourself without them — the snapshot and backup
locks still protect what they lock.

**TLS.** `[tls] enabled = true` with `cert_file` and `key_file` puts the gRPC
API (port 3374) on TLS; adding `client_ca_file` requires a client certificate
signed by that CA. The REST API on `[server] rest_port` (default 3375) stays
plain HTTP unless `[tls] rest = true` is also set; then it is served over TLS
with the same certificate (without client certificates: REST callers carry a
bearer token, and the web UI proxies to it over a pinned loopback connection).
REST clients such as the Proxmox plugin then use `https://`. Clients:

```bash
sds --tls-ca /etc/sds/ca.crt node list                 # verify against this CA
sds --tls-cert me.crt --tls-key me.key --tls-ca ca.crt node list   # mutual TLS
```

`--tls` alone verifies against the system trust store; `--tls-server-name`
overrides the name checked; `--tls-insecure` encrypts without verifying. Each
has an environment variable (`SDS_TLS`, `SDS_TLS_CA`, `SDS_TLS_CERT`,
`SDS_TLS_KEY`, `SDS_TLS_SERVER_NAME`, `SDS_TLS_INSECURE`).

**Audit.** Every state-changing API call is recorded with caller, target,
outcome and latency in the controller database (`[audit] enabled`, default
true; `include_reads = true` records reads too). Read it at `GET /v1/audit`
on the REST API, or in the web UI. Entries are kept for `retention_days`
(default 180), and never more than `max_entries` (default 200000) of them, so
a flood of calls cannot fill the metadata volume. An entry dropped by the cap
before its retention ran out raises a critical `audit.truncated` event.

The database trail is only as trustworthy as the controller host: whoever
holds it can rewrite it. To keep a copy they cannot, send the trail off the
cluster as it is written:

```toml
[audit]
syslog = "tls://logs.example.com:6514"   # or tcp://host:514, udp://host:514
syslog_ca = "/etc/sds/logs-ca.pem"       # tls only; empty = system roots
webhook_url = "https://audit.example.com/sds"
webhook_token = "..."                    # sent as Authorization: Bearer
```

Syslog gets one RFC 5424 message per entry, facility 13 ("log audit"),
newline-framed over TCP. The webhook gets each batch as a JSON POST,
`{"source": "sds-controller", "records": [{"seq": N, "event": {...}}]}`. Either
is sent in order and from where it last left off: each destination's position
is kept with the trail, so a destination that was down gets everything when it
is back, and a controller that takes over after a failover carries on where
the last one stopped. A resend after a failure can repeat an entry, never skip
one; `seq` tells a duplicate from a gap. A destination failing for five
minutes raises `audit.shipping_failed`. UDP can lose messages unnoticed; use
TCP or TLS.

Point it at storage the cluster's credentials cannot rewrite: a log server
you run elsewhere, or a collector writing to an object store with Object Lock.

## 17. Kubernetes

SDS ships a CSI driver. Volumes are DRBD resources; a pod moving between nodes
gets its storage promoted on the new one.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: sds
provisioner: sds.csi.liliang-cn.com
parameters:
  pool: thin-pool
  replicas: "2"
```

Other parameters: `storageType` (`lvm`, the default, or `zfs`),
`resourceProfile` (take pool, replicas and storage type from a profile; `pool`
may then be omitted), `resourceLabels` (`key=value,...`), `faultDomainLabel`
(default `host`), and `allowRemoteVolumeAccess: "true"`, which opts a volume
into diskless attachment so a pod can run on a node that holds no replica.

**I/O limits.** `readBytesPerSecond`, `writeBytesPerSecond` (sizes such as
`200Mi`), `readIOPS` and `writeIOPS` cap a pod's I/O to its volume: when the
volume is published, the node plugin writes them for the volume's device into
the pod's cgroup (`io.max`). That needs cgroup v2 with the `io` controller
enabled for pod cgroups, and the node plugin's `/sys/fs/cgroup` mount from
`deploy/k8s/30-node.yaml`; where they are missing the volume is still
published, without limits, and the node plugin logs why. The limits are fixed
per StorageClass: change one by moving the volume to another class.

The manifests are in `deploy/k8s` (see its README); the CSI section of
[deployment-guide.md](deployment-guide.md) covers installation.

**Proxmox VE** has the counterpart: a storage plugin (type `sds`) that backs VM
disks with SDS resources over the controller's REST API. It is in
`deploy/proxmox`, with its requirements and install steps in that README.
`deploy/proxmox/bootstrap.sh`, run on one PVE node, does those steps for an
existing PVE cluster: DRBD from LINBIT's repository on every node, the
controller, node registration, the pool, Self-HA, the plugin and the
`storage.cfg` entry.

## 18. The AI Copilot

`sds-ai` is an optional service that answers questions about the cluster in the
web UI's Copilot sidebar. It reaches the cluster through `sds-mcp`: every
read-only tool, plus a fixed list of day-to-day writes (creating pools,
resources, profiles, gateways, HA configs, snapshots and backups; adding disks,
caches, volumes, replicas and DR; attaching and detaching diskless clients;
mounting, resizing, setting options, labels and profiles; starting a gateway;
undrain; verify; WAN repair and endpoint changes), each of which waits in the
chat panel until the operator approves that call with its arguments shown.
Deleting, restoring, unmounting, changing roles, evicting, draining and
stopping are not available to it at all; it proposes them and the operator runs
them from the UI. It listens on `127.0.0.1:7634` by default (`SDS_AI_ADDR`;
any non-loopback address requires a token in `SDS_AI_TOKEN` or
`/etc/sds/token`); the web UI proxies `/ai/*` to port 7634 on its own node.

Two things determine how useful it is:

- **Its knowledge base.** Check what it has: `GET /ai/kb/list`. A near-empty one
  makes it fall back on the model's own memory, which for a specific question
  about your cluster is how you get a confident wrong answer. Feed it with
  `POST /ai/kb/ingest` (a directory on the node running `sds-ai`) or
  `POST /ai/kb/doc` (one document). `GET /ai/kb/doctor` checks that retrieval
  over the index still returns results.
- **The embedder matching the index.** `SDS_AI_EMB_DIM` (default 768) must
  equal the width the index was built at. Change the embedder to one of a different width and every
  search silently returns nothing — no error, just no results. `/ai/kb/list`
  reports the width read back from the index, which is how you check.

Send the same `session_id` across turns and it follows a conversation; omit it
and every question starts from nothing.

## 19. Routine operations

**Before a node reboot**

```bash
sds node drain node1
# ... work ...
sds node undrain node1
sds resource status <each affected resource>   # wait for UpToDate everywhere
```

**Growing a volume**

```bash
sds resource resize-volume db 0 200G
# then grow the filesystem on the Primary
ssh <primary> sudo resize2fs /dev/drbd<minor>
```

**Replacing a disk**

Drain the node, remove its replica, replace the disk, recreate the pool, add the
replica back, and wait for the resync to finish before touching the next node.

**Upgrading the controller**

```bash
# build for the nodes, not for the machine you build on
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 make build
scp bin/sds-controller <node>:/tmp/
ssh <node> "sudo systemctl stop sds-controller && \
  sudo install -m 0755 /tmp/sds-controller /opt/sds/bin/sds-controller && \
  sudo systemctl start sds-controller"
```

`/opt/sds/bin` is where the shipped unit file runs it from; copy to whatever
path your unit's `ExecStart` names (`systemctl cat sds-controller`). Set
`GOARCH` to the nodes' architecture (`arm64` for aarch64).

With Self-HA on, do not stop or restart the controller by hand: drbd-reactor manages it, and stopping it is an unplanned failover.
Replace the binary on every standby node first, then
`sds ha evict sds-meta` to move the controller onto one of them, then
replace it on the node it left.

**Checking that replicas really hold the same data**

Every replica can say `UpToDate` and still differ — a disk that returned the
wrong block, a write that never reached one copy. Only reading both finds it:

```bash
sds resource verify db --wait 30m     # compare every replica with the Primary
sds resource verify db                # still running? run it again to follow it
sds resource verify db --resync       # make the copies identical
```

DRBD records what may differ in an out-of-sync bitmap. A verify **adds** to it
and never clears it, and marks outlive whatever made them — an earlier verify,
an interrupted resync, a reconnect at equal generation. So a peer can show
most of its volume "marked out of sync" while its data is in fact identical to
the source. `verify` therefore reports the two apart: what it found itself, and
what was already marked. `--resync` copies the source's data over every marked
block, which is harmless when the copies are identical and is the only thing
that clears the marks. It copies from `--node` (default the Primary), refuses a
source that is not Primary unless another replica agrees with it, and never
overwrites a Primary.

The controller verifies every resource on its own, one at a time, on
`storage.verify_schedule` (cron, default `0 3 1 * *`: monthly; `""` turns it
off). Marked blocks raise `resource.out_of_sync`; clearing them is left to you.

Resources on thin pools resync with `rs-discard-granularity`, so a full resync
(a new replica, a failback) keeps the target thin instead of allocating every
block. Resources created before this was a default can get it with
`sds resource set-options <name> --drbd-options disk/rs-discard-granularity=65536`.

**Checking a cluster you have not looked at in a while**

```bash
sds health-check
sds resource list
sds event list --min-severity warning
sds backup schedule list # did the last scheduled backup fail?
sds backup list          # when was the newest 'completed' one?
sds channel test <each>  # would you actually be told?
```

## 20. When something is wrong

Start here:

```bash
sds resource status <name>
sds event list --resource <name>
ssh <node> sudo drbdadm status <name>
ssh <node> sudo journalctl -u drbd-reactor -n 50
```

### Reading the status

`sds resource status` prints one line per node, `role=… disk=… repl=…`;
`drbdadm status` on a node prints the same states as `role:`, `disk:`,
`peer-disk:` and `replication:`, plus `quorum:no` when the node has lost it.

| What you see | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `role=Primary` on exactly one node | Normal. |
| `role=Secondary` everywhere | Nobody is serving I/O. Normal for an idle resource; a problem if something should be mounted. |
| `disk=UpToDate` | This replica has every byte. |
| `disk=Inconsistent` | Mid-resync, or never synced. Wait. |
| `disk=Outdated` | This copy is known stale — it will not be promoted, which is correct. |
| `disk=Diskless` | No local copy. Expected on a tiebreaker or a diskless client; a fault anywhere else. |
| `peer-disk:DUnknown` (drbdadm) | Cannot see that peer at all. Network, or the peer is down. |
| `repl=Established` | Healthy. |
| `repl=StandAlone` | The connection was dropped, usually after a split brain. It will not reconnect by itself. |
| `quorum:no` (drbdadm) | This replica may not serve I/O. See below. |

### Common situations

**I/O suspended on a resource, `quorum:no`.** The replica set cannot form a
majority. Usually a two-diskful resource with no tiebreaker after losing one
node. Register a third node so a tiebreaker can be added. As an emergency
measure on the surviving diskful node only:

```bash
sudo drbdsetup resource-options <res> --quorum=1     # runtime only, not persisted
# ... once the peer is back and UpToDate ...
sudo drbdsetup resource-options <res> --quorum=majority
```

Change it on one node only. The peers keep `majority`, so a peer starting alone
still cannot be promoted — which is what stops this from becoming a split brain.

**A resource is stuck `Inconsistent` after creation.** A fresh DRBD device needs
one copy declared authoritative. `resource create` does this itself; if it was
interrupted before that step, promote once by hand with
`sds resource primary <res> <node> --force`, then
`sds resource secondary <res> <node>`.

**`StandAlone` after a split brain.** Two copies diverged. Decide which one is
authoritative — SDS will not guess — then discard the other's changes and
reconnect it. Anything written to the discarded side is lost, so look at both
before choosing.

**A gateway will not start.** Look at the OCF agent, not at drbd-reactor:

```bash
ssh <node> sudo drbd-reactorctl status
ssh <node> sudo journalctl -u "ocf.rs@*<resource>*" -n 50
```

The usual causes are a missing package (`nfs-kernel-server`, `targetcli-fb`, the
`nvmet-tcp` module) and a service IP already in use.

**A node is unreachable but the machine is up.** SDS reaches nodes over SSH
from the controller node. After a node is rebuilt its host key changes and
every operation fails with an empty error; clear the stale key and restart the
controller.

**Nothing is alerting.** Check three things in order: `[alert] enabled = true`,
at least one channel in `sds channel list` that is not muted (or a webhook
under `[alert]`), and `sds channel test` on each of them.

### Getting more detail

```bash
sds event watch                # follow live
sds rbac whoami                # "permission denied" that should not be
journalctl -u sds-controller -f    # on the controller node
```

On the REST API (`[server] rest_port`, default 3375, with the same token): `GET /v1/logs` returns the
controller's recent log lines from memory, `GET /v1/audit` who changed what,
and `POST /v1/diagnostics/collect` runs a fixed set of named, read-only
collectors on the nodes (`{"nodes": [...], "collectors": [...]}`, both
defaulting to all) — DRBD status, config and kernel state, kernel errors, the
drbd-reactor, promoter and SDS journals, failed units, storage, mounts —
without anyone logging in. The web UI's Logs page shows the first two;
`sds-mcp` has all three (`sds_log_list`, `sds_audit_list`, `sds_diagnose`).

[Known failure modes](deployment-guide.md#13-known-failure-modes) in the
deployment guide lists the failures that are hardest to diagnose.
