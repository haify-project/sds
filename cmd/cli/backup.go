  * The first backup of a resource to a target is a full image. Later ones are
    incremental on thin pools: only blocks changed since the last backup are
    sent. A thick (non-thin) volume is backed up in full every time.
  * An incremental restores only together with every backup down to its full
    one, so none of those can be deleted while a later one exists. After 30
    incrementals the next backup is full again.
  * One snapshot per resource and target stays on the node as the base for the
    next incremental; it holds whatever the volume overwrote since.
  * LVM-backed volumes only. A ZFS zvol has no snapshot block device to read,
    so those resources are refused rather than half-supported.`

This is the layer snapshots and WAN DR are not. A snapshot lives in the same

Backups are taken from a storage-native snapshot, never from the live volume,
so the image is crash-consistent.
